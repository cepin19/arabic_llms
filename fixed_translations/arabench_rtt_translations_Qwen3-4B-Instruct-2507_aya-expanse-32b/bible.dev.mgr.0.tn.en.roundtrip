Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah is the father of Manasseh. Manasseh is the father of Amon. Amon is the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehonias and his brother. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go to Babylon.
Then the family continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zeruiah was the father of Abishai. Abishai was the father of Joab. Joab was the father of Azariah.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achimaas. Achimaas was the father of Eliphelet.
Eliezer was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob. Elwood was the father of Eliezer.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abram to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ. And Jesus was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: Mary, his mother, was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband Joseph was a godly man. He did not want to expose her to public shame. So he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
He will be born a son. You shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled.
The girl will live as a child, the birth will be to a son, and I will name him Emmanuel. (Isaiah 7:14) The name Emmanuel means "God with us."
Joseph, pay attention. He did as God's king commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
But he did not love her even after she gave birth to a son, and Joseph named him Jesus.
Wise men visit Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This was during the reign of Herod, king of Judea. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
For he had connected with all the prominent sons of the people, and he had connected with the scholars. And he asked him about the place of Christ's birth.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they answered. "That is what the messenger wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
So Herod summoned the wise men secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. And he said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you have found him, bring me word. Then I too will go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, their joy increased.
The magi went to the house, and there they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down to him and worshiped him, and they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God sent them a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their homeland by a different route. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," the angel said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose. All night, he departed with the child and his mother Mary into Egypt.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the male rulers had calculated the time. He was greatly angered. He issued orders regarding Bethlehem and its surroundings. All the boys two years old and under had to be killed. This corresponded to the time the rulers had seen the star.
Therefore, what the Messenger said about them was true. He said:
A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted because they are dead. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Christ returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream in Egypt. In the dream, a king from the mercy of God appeared to him.
The soothsayer said, "Drink! The boy and his mother took off for the land of Israel. Those who tried to kill the boy died."
So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
But after they had left, it came to pass that Archelaus was king in Judea. Archelaus reigned in place of his father Herod, and Joseph was afraid to go there. When he was warned in a dream, Joseph returned to the land of Galilee.
He lived there in a town called Nazareth. So what the prophets said about Jesus was true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Rise from your sins! The King of Heaven is near."
John is the person about whom the prophet Jesus spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food consisted of insects and wild bees.
The people came out to meet him from Jerusalem and all Judea and from the whole region along the Jordan.
When they admitted their mistake, John patted them on the back.
John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees deserving of the place of torment. He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves before others, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God."
Produce fruit that proves you have turned away from your sins.
Do not think that you are saying to yourselves, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, even stones could be turned into children of Abraham.
The plan is deep-rooted. All trees that do not produce good fruit will be destroyed. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, and I call upon you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His fate is in his own hands to provide for his land. He will gather his grain into the barn. But he will love the grain with the unquenchable fire. Jesus is tested.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. And he wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "We will stay on this for now. It is acceptable for us to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." And John agreed.
Since Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment the sky opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him."
Jesus is attracted.
The Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of not eating, Jesus was exhausted.
The devil took him to a high mountain and said, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
So the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
If you are a son of God, lie down. And it is written, "God will make him to fall by the edge of the sword, and will deliver him into the hands of his enemies, and will cast him out of his land, and will make him to lie down on a stone." (Surah 91:11, 12)
Jesus replied, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
If you say, "Peace be upon you, and I worship you," I will give you all this.
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan!" And he answered, "Go away, Satan, for it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
So the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was in prison. And when Jesus heard this, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and moved to live in the town of Capernaum, which was beside the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Therefore, what the prophet Joshua said came to pass. He said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! Land on the Mediterranean coast! Region south of the Jordan River!
The people who live in darkness will see a great light. They live in a very dark land. But the light will shine upon them. (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, "Repent of your sins!" he said. "The Kingdom of Heaven is near." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day he was walking by the Lake of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"I appoint you, follow Me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Since they followed him, they followed him and forgot their nets.
Then he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them.
Quickly they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
News about him spread all over Syria. And people brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others were unable to move. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea, while others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Jesus gives wishes.
Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
Peace be upon the spiritually needy. The King of Heaven belongs to them.
He who loves sorrow will be given his fill of it.
Peace be upon him who does not pride himself. They will be given the earth.
The heavens are worthy of those who love justice and hold fast to it. They will be rewarded.
Those who show mercy are shown mercy.
Peace be upon those whose hearts are pure. They will see God.
The peace activists are preachers, and they will be called the children of God.
Peace be upon those who are punished for doing what is right. The King of the Heavens belongs to them.
"Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you for My sake." "Blessed are you when they say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake."
Smile and work cheerfully. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people harm the messengers who lived long ago. Salt and light
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city on a mountain cannot be hidden.
People don't light a lamp and leave it under a bushel basket. Instead, they put it on its stand, and then it gives light to everyone in the house.
Similarly, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father who is in heaven. Jesus gives full meaning to the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish what is in the law or in the prophets. I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill. I have come to make the full meaning of what is in the law and the prophets clear.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before even a single letter of the Law passes away. Not even the smallest detail of the Law will pass away until everything is accomplished.
Do not break any of the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be considered least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep and teach these commandments, you will be considered great in the kingdom of heaven.
Here is what I say to you. You must be nearer to God than the Pharisees and the taught men. If you are not, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Amen.
I have heard what was said to those who lived long ago. They were told, "You shall not kill" (Exodus 20:13), and whoever kills will be punished for it.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raka,' must be brought before the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the fire of hell.
Imagine that you are presenting an offering on the altar, and you feel that your brother has something against you.
Keep your gift in front of the altar. Go first and reconcile with your brother. Then come back and present your gift.
Imagine someone has a lawsuit against you and serves you with papers in court. Analyze the problem quickly. Do it on your way there. If you don't, the judge might rule against you. The clerk might rule against you. And you might be detained in jail.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. Don't you dare leave until you pay the last penny! Adultery
I heard them say, "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better to lose one eye than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one of your limbs than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. Divorce.
He said, "When a man marries his wife, if she flees, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But that is what I am telling you: anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman causes her to commit adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him. Oath.
Once again, I heard what he said to your people long ago. He said to them, "Do not break the covenants you have made with your Lord. Keep the promises you have made to Him."
But this is what I say to you: Do not take oaths at all—not by heaven, because it is God’s throne;
Do not make them in the name of Earth. This is the footstool of God. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
And do not write on your own behalf. Do not deprive anyone of a hair or a thread.
Simply, let "yes" mean "yes," and let "no" mean "no." Anything beyond this is from the devil. Be polite to others.
I heard them say, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" (Exodus 21:24; Luke 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21).
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well."
Since someone is taking you to court to get a jacket, let them take you for the whole outfit.
If someone tells you to walk a mile, walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not refuse him who asks of you a loan. Love your enemies.
I heard them say, "Love your brother" (Luke 19:18) "Hate your enemy."
But this is what I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you.
"So you will be children of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
If you only give to your own people, what do you do more than others? Even people who don't believe in them do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to those who suffer from poverty.
Beware of doing good deeds in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the suffering, do not announce it with a sounding trumpet. Do not be like those who pretend to be holy. They proclaim what they do in the church and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am telling you is the truth. They have received their reward in full.
When you give to those in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
If you continue, you will continue in secret. Your Father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like those who show off their piety. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that others may see them. What I am telling you is the truth. They have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. The Son sees in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Do not be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask for it.
"This is how you pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom will be restored. And what you see happening on earth will be restored as it is in heaven.
Send us our daily bread today.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
Keep us from falling into error when we are tempted. And protect us from the devil.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do, you will also be forgiven from heaven.
But if mistakes are not forgiven to people, your father will not forgive you your mistake. Fasting.
When you go without eating, you don't look as sad as those who only show that they are pious. They show their faces in sorrow. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I'm telling you is the truth. They have received the full reward.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
"So people will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who cannot be seen, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven."
Do not store up treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up your treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart will live where your money is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes were comfortable. Your whole body would be covered in darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. One will be despised and the other honored. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
"Do they not look at the souls in the heavens, whether they have no guardians looking after them, or whether they do not keep count of them, or whether they do not store them in a treasury? Yet they are equal in their sight. Have they not been greater than them?"
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothes? Look at how the wild flowers grow. They neither work nor spin.
But that is what I tell you. Not even in all his glory was Solomon arrayed like one of these.
If God clothes the grass in such a way, why won't He clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today, and tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!
So do not worry. Do not say, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who are denied are used for everything that is used. Your Father in heaven knows that you need this.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Who are you accusing?
Do not judge people, lest you be judged.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
You notice a speck in your friend's eye, but you ignore the log in your own.
How do you tell your friend: "I'm removing a piece of ceramic grit from your eye"? How do you say this while there's a piece of wood in your eye?
You hypocrite! First, take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not cast your pearls before swine. Do not throw your dreams to the cows. If you do, they might walk all over them. Then they'll come back and silence you. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. The door will remain open for him who knocks.
If your son asks for bread, who will give him a stone?
Or suppose he asks for a fish. Who among you will give him a tiger?
Even if you are prepared, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more will the Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
In all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. The great and the small gate.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people go this way.
But the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find it. A tree and its fruits.
Drink from the oppressors. They come to appear as sheep. But inside, they are all wolfish.
You can tell if they are genuine by what they do. "Do people gather leaves from trees? Do they gather fruit from stones?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
So I tell them plainly, "I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!" Wise builders and those who build intelligently.
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The storm rages, the water rises, and the winds blow and beat against this house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The storm abates, the water rises, the winds blow and breathe upon this house, and it comes down with a great crash.
Jesus finished saying all these things, and the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He gave lessons as if he had authority. He didn't speak like their law teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain, and great crowds followed him.
One of the lepers, who had not been punished, came forward and knelt before Jesus, saying, "Sir, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean!" Suddenly, the man's disease was healed.
So Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"My servant," he said, "is suffering at home and cannot move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal them."
The man replied, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you enter my house. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I am myself a man under supervision. And I have individuals who carry out my orders. I tell one, "Go," and he goes. I tell one, "Come," and he comes. I tell my slave, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you that many people will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven, together with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who think they belong to the king will be thrown outside into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
So Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and it will be done for you as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's wife's mother lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus took her hand, she rose, and began to help him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He took it to fulfill what the prophet Jesus said. He said, "I have prepared what we must suffer. He took the sickness that we must suffer." (Isa 53:4) Jesus became a learner.
Jesus saw the crowds around him, and he ordered his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a law teacher came to him. He said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
A disciple said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat. His disciples followed him.
It burst upon the lake with a joyful splash. The waves rippled with the duck. Spring is coming, it grows.
The students moved and warned him, saying, "Sir! Stay with us! We are dying!"
He answered, "You of little faith! Why are you afraid?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became a great calm.
The students were astonished. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the sea in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. These men were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"Son of God, what do you mean by this?" they shouted. "Have you come to condemn us before our time?"
A large herd of pigs was eating not long ago.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water.
Those who used to cast out demons fled. They entered the city and told everyone all that had happened. They informed the people about what had befallen the men who were possessed.
So the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat, set out across the lake, and arrived at his destination.
Some men brought a paralyzed man to Jesus. He was lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
So some of the law teachers said to their relatives, "This worker is talking about something very bad!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, "Why are you thinking such evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say "Your sins are forgiven" or "Rise and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who could not walk, "Rise, take up your bed, and go to your home."
The man got up and went home.
When they saw this, their amazement increased. And they gave thanks to their God for granting such power to human beings. Jesus chooses Matthew.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And Matthew got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus dined at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and those called "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and His disciples.
When they saw this, the teachers asked them, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
Go and learn what it means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to call those who think they are righteous with God to follow me. I came to call sinners to follow me. Jesus is asked about consistency.
One day, John's disciples came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus replied, "How can wedding guests be sad while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't put new clothes on top of old clothes. Because the new piece will cause the old one to sag. And the damage will become worse.
People are not put to sleep in old bags. If they did that, the bags would burst, the paper would end, and the bags would burst. No, people are put to sleep in new bags. Then both are saved. "A dead girl and a sick woman"
As Jesus was saying these things, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus ascended and went with him, and his believers went with him.
At that moment, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a bleeding disorder for twelve years, and she touched the edge of his garment.
She said, "I just need to get dressed, and then I'll be fine."
Jesus waited and looked at her. "Sister, do not lose hope," he said. "Your faith has made you well." The woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the large crowds.
He said, "Go, the girl is not dead, she is just fainting." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus was leaving, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he touched their eyes and said, "It shall be as you believed."
They saw him again, and he warned them sternly: "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They were talking about it everywhere in that area.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The people were amazed, and they said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Yashua moved throughout all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and illness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them; they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
So Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
So ask the owner of the farm to send workers to his field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Then Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. It ends with James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The others are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent the twelve with these instructions: "Don't go among the Gentiles," he said. "Don't enter any Samaritan town."
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like cows that have been milked dry.
When you walk, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not take any gold, copper, or metal in your belt.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, shoes, or walking gear. The worker should be provided with what they need.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone who accepts you. Stay in this person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, welcome to those who live there.
If this house turns its face to you, return it with peace. If it does not turn to you, do not return to it.
Some people may not accept you and won't hear your words. If they won't listen, shake the dust from your feet when you leave this house or this city.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, Sodom and Gomorrah will be easier to deal with than that city.
I send you together like legs on a dog. So be like lilies and be as polite as chickens.
Drink! You will be given to the local judges. They will punish you in their temples.
You will be handed over to the Muslims and kings because of Me, and you will testify against them and those who were not Jews.
But when they catch you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, you'll get the right words to say.
It will not be you who writes. Your father's spirit will write through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed, and fathers will hand over their children, and children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will get used to you because of me. But whoever stays until the end will succeed.
When people are attacked somewhere, flee to another place. What I am telling you is the truth. Your journey through the cities of Israel will not end before the Son of Man comes.
A student does not surpass his teacher, and a servant does not surpass his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house has been named Beelzebul, what do those who live in it expect?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything hidden will be revealed, and everything concealed will be made known.
What you say at night, you say in the day. What is said in your ear, you say from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are twenty planes sold for a single dinar? But doesn't every plane fall to the ground without your father knowing?
"He counts every hair on your head!"
So do not fear, for you are worth more than many sparrows.
I have no one to say before men that they know me? I will say before my Father who is in heaven that I know him.
But what about those who say before men that they do not know me? I will also say before my Father who is in heaven that I do not know them.
Don't think I've come to surrender the land. I haven't come to surrender. I've come to surrender a sword.
I am coming to strike for "son against father, daughter against mother, and married daughter against her married mother.
A man's enemies are the men of his own house. (Micah 7:6)
Whoever is more attached to his father or mother than to me is not worthy of me. Whoever is more attached to his son or daughter than to me is not worthy of me.
And whoever faces their responsibility and follows me is not worthy of me.
If someone finds their life, they will lose it. And if they lose their life because of me, they will find it.
"Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me."
If one takes as a prophet one who is considered a prophet, one will receive the reward of a prophet. And if one takes as a lover one who is considered a lover, one will receive the reward of a lover.
Imagine someone giving a cup of cold water to a small child following me. What I'm going to tell you is a fact. That person will certainly receive a reward.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus continued teaching the twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is supposed to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus replied, "Go to John and tell him what you hear and see."
Blind people receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
Peace be upon those who were not made lawful for Muslims by gold.
As the son was leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If so, what do you go to see? A man in fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in the schools of kings.
So what did I see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He who was spoken of in the Holy Book says, "I will send my messengers before you. I will make your way ready." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is the truth. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law pointed to the coming of John.
If you accept him, Johan is the Jew who was supposed to come.
"Those who hear, let them hear."
I compare people today to children sitting in the squares and calling out to people. They say,
"We played for you, but you don't dance. We made funeral music, but you don't feel sad."
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. People thought, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Wisdom is justified by her children. The cities that do not repent will not be forgiven.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent.
How much more would the people of Korazin have repented, and the people of Bethsaida, if the miracles that were done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: On the Day of Judgment, you will find it easier to deal with Tyr and Sedon than with yourselves.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to the realm of the dead. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would still be standing today.
But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for Sodom than for you. Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. That's what I asked for.
The father gave me everything. The father is the only one who teaches the son. And the only ones who teach the father are the son and those whom the son has chosen to be taught.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Become my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble. You will find rest for your souls.
I serve you gladly and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain.
They saw the disciples. And they said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it!"
Jesus replied, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry?
So he entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed for the priests to eat.
Haven't you read the law? It explains that on every feast day, the monks at the altar are to do their work on that day. But they are not considered liable.
I tell you, whoever is greater than the altar is here.
The book says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6), you do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not criticize those who have not sinned.
An honest son is the master on Saturday.
Then Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand. And the Pharisees sought a reason to accuse Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If your ox falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take it and lift it out?"
Man is worth more than sheep! Therefore, the laws allow us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus, the servant chosen by God.
Jesus knew all the plans of the Pharisees. So he departed from there. And many people followed him, and he healed all the sick.
But this warns them not to tell who he is.
This was to fulfill what the prophet Jesus had said:
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen; he is the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations.
He neither flees nor screams. His voice is not heard in the streets.
He does not break a bruised reed, nor quench a dimly burning wick, but upholds the weak and helps the oppressed.
The nations will rally against him. (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons was brought to be delivered. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then he learned to speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and they asked, "Could this be the Son of David?"
The Parisians heard this and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that you cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do the demons cast them out? So then, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think about this. How do you enter a strong man's house and take what he owns? You must tie him up first, and then steal his house.
"Whoever is not with me is against me. Whoever does not gather with me scatters."
So this is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But evil words spoken against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. Each tree is known by its fruit.
You two are so inconsistent! How can you say something good if you're inconsistent? Think about what you say in your hearts.
A good person says good things, and this springs from the good that is stored within them. And a bad person says bad things, and this springs from the evil that is stored within them.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, or by your words you will be condemned." -
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered, "Evil and afraid people demand a stunning sign! But the only sign that will be given is the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. The same will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The Lady of the South will look upon the Day of Reckoning with the people who live now, and will prove them guilty. She has come from afar to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and that one greater than Solomon is here now.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It passes through dry places, looking for a place to rest, but it finds none.
He said, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrived, he found the house empty. The house had been cleaned and tidied.
"And he will guide the evil one, and he will deserve seven spirits more evil than him. They will come out and live among them. This man will deserve what is coming to him. This is the time when it will be in the current human race." "The mother of Jesus and her sisters"
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his mother and brother were standing outside, wanting to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and your brother are waiting outside the door. They want to talk to you."
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Yasees bought on a scale. He said, "Here is my mother! There are my brothers!"
Anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Many gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in the boat. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things in detail. He said, "A farmer goes out to scatter his seed."
The seed fell on the ground. Some of it fell on the path. And the birds came and ate it.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, the plants ignited and went out, because they had no roots.
The other seeds fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and choked them.
As other seeds fell on good soil, they produced a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times greater than what was sown.
"Those who hear, let them hear."
The students contacted him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He replied, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. It is not given to those who are unworthy."
To everyone who has will more be given, and they will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what they have will be taken from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they do not see. They listen, but they do not hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah the prophet: "You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive."
Their hearts grew hard; they hear with their ears, but do not understand; they see with their eyes, but do not perceive. Otherwise they might turn and be healed. (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Many messengers and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about ownership but do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they don't have roots. So they last a short time. They quickly abandon the faith when they face problems or difficulties because of the message.
Others receive the seed that falls among the thorns. They hear the message. But then the worries of life and the deceitful promises of good occupy them. They prevent it from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on the good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a harvest that is a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was planted. The story of the sower.
Jesus told the crowds another story. "The kingdom of heaven is like this," he said. "A man sowed good seeds in his field."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy placed a nest among the grains, then left.
The grains began to grow and produce their grains, and at the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's workers came to him and said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did these weeds come from?"
"One of the enemies did that," he replied. And he asked the workers, "Do you want us to go and remove the impurities?"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat with the weeds."
Prepare both of them together until it is obtained. At that time, tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them. First, gather the impurities, and sift them into bags and sift them. Then gather the grains, and sift them into my storehouse. "The Parable of the Growing Seed and the Yeast"
Yesis told the crowds another story. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a wheat seed. A person took a seed and put it in a field."
This is the smallest of your seeds. But when it grows, it becomes larger than every plant in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a mustard seed, which a woman took and mixed in with a bushel of meal. The mustard seed is smaller than all the seeds on earth, yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade."
Jesus said all these things to the crowd in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
So what the messenger said came true. He said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that have been hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalms 78:2) Jesus interprets the story of the coral reefs.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. And the weeds represent the people who belong to evil.
The sower is the devil, the fruit is the Day of Judgment, and the workers are the angels.
Plants are drawn and burned in the fire. Thus will be the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will cast out his elders, and pluck up all things that cause sin from his kingdom, and cast out all who do evil.
They will be thrown into the blazing furnace. People will weep and wail for them.
"For the citizens of God's kingdom will shine like the sun. Whoever has ears, let them hear. Tales of the hidden storehouse and the gems."
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
The one who found it was important. He fled and sold everything he had, and bought this treasure. The net's story.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake and gathered every kind of fish.
When they are full, the fishermen haul them up on the shore, then they sit and gather the good fish into bags, but they throw away the bad ones.
This is the form that will appear on the Day of Judgment. The angels will move. Those who did wrong will be separated from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus went on to tell more stories. Then he moved on.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were astonished. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Is this the son of the Muslim? Is his mother's name Mary? Are his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Are all his sisters with us? How did this man acquire all these things?
They never liked him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He did only a few miracles there because they did not believe.
John the Baptist's head on a platter
At that time Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, heard about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. Rise from the earth! For he has the power to perform miracles."
Herod seized John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John told Herod, "You are forbidden by law to own it."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John was a prophet.
At the feast of Herod the king, the daughter of Herodias danced before him and his guests. And Herod was greatly pleased.
So I promised him the promise to give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say, so the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was deeply moved. However, he remembered his promises and the guests he had. So he ordered one of his servants to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was placed on a large platter and given to the girl, who then carried it to her mother.
John's sons came and took his body and buried it. Then they came and told Joseph. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Yusef heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be left alone. So he set off in a boat to a quiet place. People heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed the sick.
As evening approached, the Muslims came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "It is getting late. Send the people away. Let them go and eat in the villages."
Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. Give them something to eat."
"We have five pieces of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them to me," he said.
So Jesus made the people sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and forgot. The followers took 12 tablets from the remainder.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. And the women and children ate. Jesus walked on water.
Quickly, Jesus sent the disciples to the boat and asked them to go ahead of him to the other side of Lake Galilee. Then he sent the crowd away.
After sending them, he ascended to the same place on the mountain to seek forgiveness. And when night came, he was alone there.
The boat was anchored off the shore. The waves were crashing against it because the wind was blowing.
Early in the morning, Jesus went out to the workers. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said, and were terrified.
Jesus immediately made himself known to them and said, "Peace be with you! Do not be afraid."
"Peace, are you?" asked Peter. "If it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Quickly, the spies grabbed his hand and dragged him away. "You trust too easily!" they said. "Why did you doubt me?" he asked.
When they entered the ship, the wind stopped.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They traveled on a lake and reached Gensarat.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding region. People sent all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow those who were sick to touch the edge of his garment, and everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. And they asked,
Why don't your students follow what the elder teaches? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus replied, "And you did not follow God's commands? You insist on following your own instructions!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said, "If anyone worships a father or a mother, he shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But permit them to tell their parents: "Any help you may receive from us is a gift dedicated to God."
So they do not need to honor their parents by your merit. You waste the words of God to keep your teachings.
"You deniers! Isaiah was truthful when he warned you. He said:
"These people respect me with their words. But their hearts are far from me."
I care not for their respect; they teach but human rules. (Isaac 29:13)
He invited people to his suite. He said, "Listen and understand."
It's not what goes into your mouth that makes you unclean, but what comes out of your mouth.
So those who were sent came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are some plants that my Father and I plant in heaven. They will be planted from the roots."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man guides another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
Do you understand all these things? Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach, and then exits the body.
But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart. That's what makes you clean.
Evil actions proceed from the heart, including murder, adultery, sexual crimes, as well as theft, false testimony, and spreading lies about others.
This is what makes you clean. But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you clean. "The faith of a woman from Canaan"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A mother from Canaan lived near Tire and Sidon. She was subject to the son of David and cried out: "Man! Son of David! Have mercy on me! My daughter is severely afflicted by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. So his disciples came to him and asked, "Send her away, for she keeps following us."
Jesus replied, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
So the woman fell at his feet and pleaded, "Lord, help me!"
Response: "It is not right for us to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus departs. He walks on Lake Galilee. Then he ascended Mount Wasat.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those with speech difficulties, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were healed. Those who could not speak began to speak. Those who were sick were made well. Those who could not walk began to walk. Those who were blind began to see. And the people praised the God of Israel.
So Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His worshipers answered him, "There is nothing here," they said. "Where will we get enough bread to feed this great crowd?"
How many loaves have you? asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few fish."
Jesus said to the crowds, "Sit down on the ground."
He took seven cans, a pack of chips, and thanked them. Then he divided them and gave them to the students, and the students gave them to the people.
They all ate and forgot. Then, the Muslim took seven balls from the remainder.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children ate too.
After Jesus had sent the people away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus asks for a stunning sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him. They asked him to show them a stunning sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky and say, 'The weather will be good, the sky is red'."
And in the morning you say, "Today it will be suspended, the sky is red and dark." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you do not understand the signs that are happening now.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign. But no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah. And He left them and went away. The Pharisees and Sadducees demanded a sign.
The students counted to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
"Be on your guard," Jesus told them. "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked about this among themselves. They said, "This must be said because we didn't bring any bread."
Yusay knew what they were talking about. He said, "You're worried about the lack of faith! Why are you talking to each other about the absence of bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five reasons for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces they collected?
Don't forget the seven on 4000? Don't forget how much it cost you?
How can you understand? I did not speak to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to be careful of the yeast in bread, but was warning them about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus moved on to the region of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples, "What do people say the Son of Man is?"
They replied: "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what about you? he asked. Who do you say I am?
Simon Peter replied: "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
Here is what I say to you. You are Peter. On this rock, I will build my church. The gates of hell will not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
So Jesus explained to his disciples that they must not tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks of his coming death.
From that time Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he will suffer many things from the elders, chief men, and scribes. He must be killed, and on the third day be raised again.
"Peter is being touched with a whip and deserves it." "No, Sir!" he said. "This will not happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will reign in the kingdom of His Father. The angels will reign with Him. And each one will be rewarded according to his deeds.
What I am telling you is the truth. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus' appearance changes.
After seven days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, and went with them to a high mountain, where they were alone.
His appearance was transformed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
In an instant, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. They were speaking with Jesus.
Peter Lysis said, "Masters, this is excellent that we are here. If I wish, I will build three tabernacles. One for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disbelievers heard this, they were shaken to the core and fell down prostrate on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And when they had come to the crowd, Jesus spoke to them and said, "Do not tell anyone what you saw." He said, "Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do the teachers say that Elijah should come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true, John is supposed to come and restore everything."
But I say to you, Elijah has already come. They did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will they do to the Son of Man.
Then the teachers realized that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a man who was possessed by a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man ran up to Jesus, knelt down before him,
"God," he said, "restore my son. He trembles and spreads out. He falls often into fire or into water."
I revealed it to your students, but they were unable to heal him.
"You brood of vipers! How long shall I remain with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to leave the child, and it departed from him. He was healed instantly.
So the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is true. Even if your faith is as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again. Therefore, the city was commanded to mourn. Jesus pays the temple tax."
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And when they had come to the other side, the tax collectors came to Peter and said to him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the people? Do they collect from their own children or from others?"
"No one else," Peter replied. "Then the children don't have to pay the tax," Jesus said to him.
But we don't want to make them laugh. Go to the lake and lower your chain. Take the first fish you catch. Open the fish's mouth. We'll find the exact amount we need. Take it and pay them what it costs, both their costs and mine.
