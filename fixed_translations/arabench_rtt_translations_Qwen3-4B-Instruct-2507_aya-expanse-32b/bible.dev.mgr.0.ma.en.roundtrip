Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the deportation to Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon until the Messiah. Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: Mary, his mother, was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a godly man. He did not want to put her to shame in public. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
He will be born a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All of this was just to make what God said spread. He said it through the messenger.
The girl will live, Father, and she will give birth to a son, and I will name him Emmanuel. (Isaiah 7:14) The name Emmanuel means "God with us."
Joseph opened his eyes. He did as the Lord commanded him. And he took Mary as his wife.
But what he had done for her was not even after she gave birth. And Joseph gave him the name Jesus.
The heavenly ones visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened during the time of King Herod of Judea. After Jesus was born, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Herod assembled all the adults and the teachers of the Law, and asked them where the Messiah would be born.
"In Bethlehem, in his hands," they are upon him. "This is what the messenger wrote. He said:"
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
For it was revealed to those who knew the secrets, and they learned from them the time of the star's appearance.
Send them to Bethlehem. And he said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report to me. Then I too will go and worship him."
Then, having heard the king, the magi departed. The star they had seen in the east went before them, until it came to a stop over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, their joy increased.
The celestial beings expanded for the house. They saw the child with his mother Mary. So they dwelt and submitted to him. Then they expanded over their wealth and paid him gold, soul, and incense.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they departed to their own country by another route. The Holy Family flees to Egypt.
Now that the heavenly beings had departed, Joseph interpreted the dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Arise!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph remained. At night, he left with the child and his mother Mary to Egypt.
This continued until King Herod died. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "I will call my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod understood that the worshipping lords had deceived him. He was furious. He ordered in Bethlehem and its surroundings. All boys under two years old were to be killed. It was in line with the time they had seen the star.
Therefore, what the prophet Jeremiah had said became a reality. He said:
She hears a voice in her ram, a voice weeping and deep sorrow. Rachel weeps for her children, and refuses to be comforted, because they are dead. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Christ returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph dreamed in Egypt. In the dream, a king from the mercy of God appeared to him.
The angels said, "Drink! Take the child and his mother, and flee to the land of Israel. Those who tried to kill the child died."
As Jesus was ascending, he took the child and his mother Mary back to the Holy Land.
But afterward he heard that Archelaus was king in Judea in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. When he was warned in a dream, he returned to the land of Galilee.
She lived in a city called Nazareth. So what the prophets said about Jesus was true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
On that day, John the Baptist went out and preached in the plains of Judaea.
He said, "Forget your sins! The King of Heaven is near."
John is the one the prophet Jesus spoke about. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
All John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a cloak made of skin. His food was dates and locusts.
The people went out from Jerusalem and from all the Judean countryside, and from all the region around the Jordan.
When they admitted their mistake, John patted them on the back.
"Then Jesus answered them, 'How is it that you say, "We are not guilty of sinning against anyone"? Have you not heard that God said, "You shall not murder"? Anyone who murders will be judged.'"
Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think that you are saying, "Abraham is our father." I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The plan is deep-rooted in the trees. All the trees that do not produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, and call you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is greater than I. I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His hand is on the handle to draw water from his bucket, and he gathers his grain into the storehouse. But he improves the broth with a fire that is not lit in advance. Jesus is tested.
Jesus withdrew from Galilee and went to the region of the Jordan. There he was baptized by John.
But John resisted. He said to Jesus, "I need the letters from you. When will you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "We'll stick with this. It's our responsibility to do this. We're carrying out God's holy plan." And Jonah agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
He governs with an iron fist.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of not eating, Jesus was exhausted.
The camel is on top of the camel. He said, "If you are the Son of God, turn this stone into bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
So the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from the temple. It is written, "He will guard his servants; he will not let them fall, but will raise them up with his hands, so that they do not dash their feet against a stone." (Surah 91:11, 12)
Jesus replied, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you say, 'I will be saved and worship you,'" he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Matthew 6:13)
Then the devil departed out of Jesus. And, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. Jesus began to preach.
John was in prison. When Jesus heard this, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Therefore, what the prophet Jesus said has come to pass. He said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! Land on the Mediterranean coast! Region east of the Jordan River!
The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a very dark land. But a light will shine upon them. (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw there two brothers. Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea. They were fishermen.
"Work, be silent," said Jesus. "I will show you who is used to make humans."
Since they left their networks and joined him.
After that, Walid saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
Quickly they greeted the boss and their father and joined Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. There, he taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and sickness among the people.
News about him spread throughout Syria. And people brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from great pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others were unable to move. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some were from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and others from the region beyond the Jordan.
Jesus gives wishes.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
Peace be upon those in need in the heart. The King of Heaven belongs to them.
Those who love sorrow will be delivered from it.
Peace be upon those who have not reached pride. They will be given the earth.
Peace be upon the users and those who prevail over the truth. They will be empowered.
Peace be upon the givers. They will be given peace.
Peace be upon those whose hearts are pure. They will see God.
Peace be upon those who seek peace. They are God's way.
Peace be upon those who are punished for what they do to the righteous. The King of the Heavens belongs to them.
Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
Stay happy and joyful. Your rewards in Heaven are great. In the same way, people wronged the prophets who lived in the past. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
People don't light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket. Instead, they put it in a place where it gives light to everyone in the house.
In parallel, let your light shine before people. Then they will see the good you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives full meaning to the law.
Don't think I'm here to abolish what is in the Sharia or what the Prophet said. I didn't come to do that. I came to reinforce its meaning.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before one jot or one tittle of the Law disappears. Even if one stroke of a letter were to vanish from the Law, it would not disappear until all things are accomplished.
Do not surrender resource after resource.
This is not enough. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Repent.
"You know what was said to those who lived in the past. It was taken from them that they should not consume. (Brothers 20:13) Anyone who consumes is considered a consumer."
But this is what I'm telling you. Don't be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the fire of hell.
Offer your gift without delay, and remember that your brother has no grudge against you.
Keep your gift in front of the altar. Invent first and forget your protocol. Then come back and present your gift.
For example, someone sues you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it on your way with him. If you don't, the judge will rule against you. The judge rules against the plaintiff. And he takes you to jail.
What I'm going to tell you is true. Don't leave until you pay the last penny! Adultery
She said: "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But that's not what I'm telling you. Don't look at a woman with the wrong intention. Anyone who looks with the wrong intention has committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is part of your body, it is better for you to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell. Divorce.
He said, "When a man marries his wife and they divorce, he must give her a divorce document." (Session 24:1)
But that is not what I am saying to you. Anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman causes her to commit adultery. It is permissible for a man to divorce his wife only if she is not faithful to him. Oath.
Again, I have heard what was said to your people before. They were told: "Do not break the promises you make to God. Keep the covenants you have promised Him."
But this is not what I am saying to you. Let no such covenants be honored. Do not honor them in the name of the heavens. This is the kingdom of God.
Do not make them in the name of Earth. This is the footstool of God. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
And don't lie about your hair, you can't bleach or straighten one hair.
Don't complete "yes" with "yes" and "no" with "no"; anything beyond that comes from the devil. Be polite to others.
You know that he said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" (Exodus 21:24; Luke 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21).
But this is what I'm telling you. Don't fight against an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them also."
As if he's taking you for a ride to ask for your jacket, just give him your jacket.
It's like he's forcing you to go a mile, so go two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not refuse him who borrows from you. Love your enemy.
She said: "Love your enemies" (Luke 19:18) "and prepare for your enemy's aggression."
But this is not what I am telling you. Love your enemies. Ask him who harms you.
"So that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"
If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
If they touch my family, won't you go beyond what they do? Even the people who touch me do that.
Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to those in need.
Learn not to do "good deeds" before people. Do not do it to be seen by them. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who show off their piety. They proclaim their deeds in the synagogues and on the streets. They want to be honored by people. What I am telling you is the truth. They have received their reward in full.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Thus your distribution will become secret. Your father will reward you. He sees what you do secretly. Prayer.
When you mend, don't be like those who keep claiming they are Muslim. They love to stand and loiter in the synagogue and the house of idolatry. They love to be seen by people. What I'm telling you is the truth. They have received their full rewards.
When you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will give you what you ask for. The Son watches what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble like the wicked do. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask for it.
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
We seek forgiveness from you; we seek forgiveness from those on behalf of whom we seek forgiveness.
Lead us away from sin and protect us from evil.
"If you forgive people their wrongdoings, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive them, neither will your Father forgive your wrongdoings."
But if they are not forgiven, your father will not forgive your sins. Fasting.
When you go without eating, you don't look as sad as those who only show that they are worthy of God. They show their sad faces. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I'm telling you is true. They have a full reward.
But when you miss a meal, pour olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Therefore, people will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who sees in secret, will see. He will repay you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
Do not keep wealth on earth. It is destroyed by ants and rust. The thief enters and arranges it.
No, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your hearts will be where your owner is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes were comfortable. Your whole body would be covered in darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. One will be favored over the other. Or they will remain loyal to one and deny the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not worry.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you afford to add an hour of worry to your life?
And why do you worry about clothing? Look at how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothing.
But that's not what I'm telling you. In all his greatness, Solomon never wore the uniform of one of these officers.
If God dresses the grass of the fields like this, why wouldn't He dress you even better? After all, the grass is here today, and tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. Your faith is very small!
So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
The people who are misers care about all these things. But the One in the heavens knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Who are you to judge others?
Do not precede people, for you will not be preceded.
You will be judged in the same way that you judge others. You will be measured by the same standard by which you measure others.
You notice a speck of dust in your friend's eye, but you ignore the log in your own.
How do you tell your friend, "I'm removing a piece of sawdust from your eye," while you've got a splinter in your own eye?
You're all done! Remove your country from your eyes first, then you'll see clearly enough to remove it from your friend's eyes.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs. Do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. The door opens for him who knocks.
If your daughter asks for bread, would either of you give her a stone?
Or suppose he asks for fish. Which one of you will benefit him with a saw?
Since you are imperfect, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
In all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the law and in the Prophet. The great and the small gate.
The gate of God's kingdom is narrow. The gate is wide and the road broad that leads to death and hell. Many go this way.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find it. A tree and its fruits.
Know the deniers. They crown you with the misguided. Rather, they cling to the crowd in confusion.
You can tell what they really are by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
Just as every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I did not know you; depart from me, you evildoers!" Wise builders and good children.
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The storm descends. The water rises. The winds blow and breathe upon this house. But it does not fall. It is built upon the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish person who builds his house on the sand.
The storm abates, the water rises, the winds blow and breathe upon this house, and it comes down with a great crash.
Jesus continued saying all these things, and the people were amazed at his teaching.
His teaching was straightforward. He didn't speak like their law teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease knelt down before Jesus, calling out, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you have the power to do so."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean!" Suddenly the man was cured of his leprosy.
So Jesus said to him, "Tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"God", he said, "conceals My servant in his house and diminishes him. He suffers greatly."
Yasees said: "I will go and heal him."
The captain replied, "Sir, I cannot receive you in my house. But speak, and I will heal my servant."
I am a responsible man. I have armed men who carry out my orders. I tell one, "Go," and he goes. I tell one, "Die," and he dies. I tell my toy, "Do this," and it does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such faith."
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west. They will sit in the kingdom of heaven. They will be beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
But those who think they belong to the queen will end up outside, in the dark. They will laugh and gnash their teeth.
So Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and it will be done for you as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's wife. She was lying in bed. She was sick with a fever.
Jesus took her hand, and her bleeding stopped. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
His actions fulfilled what the prophet Jesus said: "He bore the punishment that we should have endured. He took on the sickness that we should have borne." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus entails cost.
Jesus saw the large crowd around him. He instructed his disciples to return to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then she sent a law teacher to him. He said, "Teacher, I will be with you wherever you go."
Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
As a follower, he said to him, "Lord, allow me to return and bring out my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat. His disciples followed him.
A humiliating storm raged on the lake. The waves rocked the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The students widened their eyes and warned him. They said, "Sir! We're done for! We're dying!"
He said, "Your faith is simple! Why do you run away?" Then he brandished his sword and blew into the wind and the dust. Everything stopped.
The students were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. These men were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"Son of God, what do you mean by 'we'?" they cried. "Have you come to accuse us before our time?"
Without a doubt, a large herd of pigs was eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who were tending the swine fled. They went into the town and told everyone all about this. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
So all the cities went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, departed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
Some men were sitting with him, a man who could not walk. He was lying on a bed. Jesus saw that they had faith. So he said to the man, "Do not lose hope, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then a few of the religious teachers said to themselves, "This worker is talking about something bad!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say "Forgive your mistake" or "Rise and belong"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who could not walk, "Rise, take up your mat, and go to your home."
The man stood out and went home.
When they saw this, they were astonished. They praised God for giving such authority to humans. Jesus chose Matthew.
Jesus was walking along, when he saw a man called Matthew. He was sitting at the tax office. "Follow me," said Jesus. Matthew stood up and followed him.
Without hesitation, Jesus was eating in Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and sat with Him and His disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked him, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
Go and learn what it means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. Jesus is asked about consistency.
One day, Abada sent John. She said to Yassos: "We and Vassivi do not eat. Why doesn't Abada's John eat?"
Jesus replied, "How can the guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People don't sew new clothes onto old ones. Because the new piece is separate from the old one, the damage spreads.
People don't fill in 3000 in old passports. If they did, the passports would be full, 3000 would run out, 3000 would be destroyed. No, all people fill in 3000 in new passports. So everything will be preserved. "A dead girl and a sick woman"
As Jesus was speaking, a synagogue leader came up and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus ascended and went with him. And his disciples went with him.
At that very moment, a woman came forward and knelt before Jesus. She had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years, and she touched the hem of his garment.
She was thinking: "I just need to hold onto Dad's clothes. Then I'll be better."
Jesus stopped and looked at her. "Sister, do not lose hope," he said. "Your faith has made you well." The woman was healed instantly.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players and the large crowds.
He said, "Go, the cat is dead. She can." But they laughed at him.
Then the crowd went away, and Jesus entered the temple. He took the woman by the hand and she went out.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus was walking away, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he rolled his eyes and said, "You will get what you deserve."
He can see with me. Jesus said to them firmly: "Most certainly he does not know about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They were talking about it everywhere in that area.
She was just walking, they sent another man to seduce her. He was possessed by the devil, unable to speak.
When the demon had come out, the man spoke, and the people were amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus traveled through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and illness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus gave to the twelve disciples power over all unclean spirits and every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of twelve teachers. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After that, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector. And Clopas, the son of Alfeus, and Thaddaeus.
The others are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas will later hand Jesus over to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go to any Gentile territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town.
No, go to the people of Israel. They are like sheep that have been scattered.
As you go, preach this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
They saw those who were sick, and they learned of those who had died.
Do not take any gold or silver or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, shoes, or walking gear. The worker will be provided with what they need.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone who will accept you. Stay in this person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If you entrust him, then restore him in peace. And if you do not entrust him, then do not restore him.
Many people will neither welcome you nor hear your words. If they do, tremble from your feet when you leave your home or your country.
What I am about to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, Sodom and Gomorrah will be easier to deal with than that city.
I send you forth as sheep among wolves. Be therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
Know! They are used to use you in the city. They use you in their mosques.
They will be delivered to the Muslims and the kings because of me, and they will testify against them and against those who had no Islam.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you are to say or how you are to say it. In that hour what you are to say will be given to you.
Do not speak. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers deliver up their brother to be killed, and fathers deliver up their children, and children rise up against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will get used to you because of me. But whoever stays until the end will succeed.
When they persecute you in one town, flee to another. What I tell you is true. Your journey through the cities of Israel will not be complete until the Son of Man comes.
A student does not surpass his teacher, nor does a servant surpass his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Belzebub, what can be expected of the rest who live in the house?
Therefore do not worry about your enemy. Whatever is secret will become revealed. Whatever is hidden will become known.
What you say in the night, you say in the day. What is whispered in your ear, you proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Twenty birds are not for sale.
Every hair on your head is accounted for!
Don't be afraid, you are more than many birds.
And what about those who say in front of people that they teach me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I teach him.
But what about those who say in front of people that they don't know me? I will say before my Father in heaven that they don't know Him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I am sent to set "son against father. The daughter refuses to match her mother. The married daughter opposes her married mother.
A man's enemies are the men of his own house. (Micah 7:6)
Whoever knows their father or mother to be older than me is not from me. Whoever knows their son or daughter to be older than me is not from me.
And whoever does not bear his burden and moves away with it is not worthy of it.
If someone finds his snake, he will lose it. And if he loses his snake because of me, he will find it.
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
As if someone welcomes a messenger as a messenger, they receive the rewards of messengers. As if someone welcomes a lover as a lover, they receive the rewards of lovers.
As if someone is giving a small child a cup of cold water. What I'm going to tell you is the truth. That person will surely receive a reward.
Isaac and Johan are smiling.
Jesus finished teaching the twelve disciples. Then he went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to meet him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is supposed to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus replied, "Go to John and tell him what you hear and see."
The seeing receive sight. The afflicted walk. The lepers are cleansed. The blind receive their sight. The dead are raised. And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
Peace be upon those who have not accepted my covenant.
As soon as John left, Dad started talking to the class about John. He said, "Why didn't you all go out to the valley to see the trees? You should have gone, you should have, you really should have."
If so, what are you walking out of? A thin-clothed man? No. People who wear thin clothes are in summer.
So what did you graduate to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, even more than a prophet.
This is what is written in the book: "I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. He who was born before him was called John the Baptist. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the day of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you accept him, Johan is the Jew who was supposed to come.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
I can't compare people today to anything else? They are like children sitting in squares and calling out to people. They say,
"We have proclaimed to you with the trumpet, but you did not hear. We have proclaimed to you with the music of death, but you did not weep."
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. People considered him "possessed by a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank; and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners. "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, for they did not repent.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to Hades."
But I tell you this: On the day of reckoning, you will find it easier to deal with Tyr and Sidon than with me.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
But I tell you this, on the Day of Judgment, Sodom will be easier on you than you will be on yourselves. Rest for all who are weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what you want.
My father taught me everything. The father is the one who teaches the son. It is not the son who teaches the father, but rather the father who chooses what to teach the son.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
"You shall be my disciples and learn from me. I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
I'm fine, and my burden is light.
Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath day, Jesus was going through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick some of the grain and eat it.
The Persians saw this. They said to Yas: "Yas! It is forbidden to do this on Friday. But your students are doing it!"
Jesus replied, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry?"
She was entering the house of God. And he and his soldiers partook of the sacred bread. Only bishops were allowed to partake of it.
Don't you read the law? It explains how the monks at the altar are to perform their duties every Saturday. But they are not considered responsible.
I tell you, whoever is greater than the altar is here.
The book says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not offer charges against the innocent.
An honest son is the master on Saturday.
After he had arrived, Jesus went to their synagogue.
My daughter was crippled and bent. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If your cow falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man is worth more than sheep! For this law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all that they planned to do to the Persians. So he fled from the place. Many followed him, and he healed all the sick.
But this one we take, don't tell anyone who he is.
These things happened to fulfill what the prophet Jesus had said. It is written,
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am comfortable with him. I will put my spirit upon him. He will bring justice to the nations, and everything will be restored to its proper order.
He does not breathe or scream. His voice is not heard in the street.
He breaks not a dead tree, nor extinguishes a weak fire. He restores all things.
Nations will depend on Him. (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub
A man possessed by demons, who was blind and could not speak, was brought to Jesus. Jesus healed him, and the man began to speak and see.
Everyone understood. They said, "Is this David's daughter?"
The Persians heard this and said, "This house drives out ghosts by the name of Beelzebub, the lord of ghosts."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he fights against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say you cast out demons by Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? So then, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think about this. How do you enter the house of a strong man and take what he owns? You must first tie him up, then steal from his house.
All that remains with me is with you. All that remains to gather the goats with me is to scatter them.
So this is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speak evil against the Holy Spirit, and it will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against humanity will be forgiven. But whoever speaks a word against the Spirit of Christ will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. Each tree is known by its fruit.
You hypocrites! How can you say something good if you are hypocrites? Your tongues say everything in your hearts.
A good person speaks good things, and it flows from the good that is stored within them. And a bad person speaks bad things, and it flows from the evil that is stored within them.
But that's not what I'm telling you. On the Day of Judgment, the elders will be held accountable for every simple word they spoke.
"In your words, you will become a sinner or a singular one." - "The Miracle Sign of John"
Some Pharisees and lawyers came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
"Evil and treacherous people demand an amazing sign! But the only sign that will be given to them is the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be. He will remain three days and three nights in the tomb.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with the people who live now. And the people of Nineveh will rise up and declare that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned from their ways when Jonah spoke to them. And behold, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming, a day is coming.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a man? It wanders through dry places, looking for a place to rest, but it finds none.
He said, "I'll go back to my old house." When he arrives, he finds the house empty. It has been cleaned and tidied up.
Then the devil goes away and takes with him seven demons even worse than himself, who enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will be with these wicked people in this day. My mother and others are lost.
Jesus was speaking to the crowds, and his mother and his brothers were outside the room. They wanted to speak to him.
Someone told him, "My mother and my children are outside. They want to speak to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Yassis was looking for someone to help him. He said, "Here is my mother! There are my brothers!"
Everyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother.
The farmer's biography
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. So he entered the sea. He positioned himself in the middle of the seas. And the people gathered on the shore.
Then he told them many things in context. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed."
He scattered the seed on the ground. Some of it fell on the path and the birds came and ate it.
Some seeds fell on the path, where the soil was thin. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When they saw the sea, the plants caught fire and collapsed because they had no roots.
The cow gains by lineage. And lineage gains, and the cow gains.
As the rest of the seeds vanished on excellent ground. And produced results 100, 60 or 30 times more than what was planted.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The students contacted him and asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He said, "You have been granted the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. It has not been given to those who are not worthy."
Anyone who has knowledge like this will produce more. In fact, they will produce a lot. If anyone does not have knowledge like this, even what little they have will be taken from them.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They cling, but they don't see. They hear, but they don't listen or understand."
For in them the words of the prophet Jesus are fulfilled, who said, "You will hear, but will not understand; you will see, but will not comprehend what you see."
The hearts of this people have become fat. They hear with their ears, but do not understand with their hearts. They see with their eyes, but do not perceive. If they did, they would hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn to their God for healing. (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is true. Many messengers and righteous people have experienced what you see. But they did not see it. They experienced what you hear. But they did not hear it.
Empower! That's the meaning of the farmer's tale.
People hear the message about the kingdom but they don't understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what is sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. They last for a short time. They quickly abandon the faith when problems or difficulties arise because of the message.
Others receive the seed that falls among the thorns. They are the ones who hear the message. But then the worries of life and the deceptions of false goods push it aside. They prevent it from bearing fruit.
But those who received the seed that fell on the good soil are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a harvest that is one hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown. The story of the weeds.
Jesus said to the people, "A new parable I tell you. 'This is what the kingdom of heaven is like,' he said. 'A man scattered good seed in his field.'"
But when everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. He put Awad in the grains and left.
You appeared like a peak and a town was formed. And how, trees became apparent.
The servants came to the owner. They said, "Sir, how can you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?"
"One of the persecuted did this," he said. "The crowd asked him, 'Are you silencing us, the gaze of the town?'"
"No," replied the owner. "As you pluck the feathers, you might pluck out the grains with them."
Keep both together until it is obtained. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them. First, gather the feathers. Tie them in bags and copy them. Then gather the grains. Bring them to my storehouse. "Tales of the Threshed Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus said to the people, "A new parable. He said, 'The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a person took and sowed in a field.'"
It is smaller than all your seeds. But when it grows up, it becomes bigger than every plant in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and sleep on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. And the yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Yasees said all these things to the people in context. He didn't say anything to the people that he didn't say in context.
The words the prophet spoke were true. He said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that were hidden from the first day the world was created." (Psalms 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the corals.
So Jesus left the crowds and went home. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. Good seeds symbolize people who belong to the kingdom, and weeds symbolize people who belong to evil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The profit is the Day of Resurrection. And the workers are the angels.
Everyone will be gathered and brought to an end in the fire. Thus will end the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man sends His angels, and He will clear His field of all causes of sin, and cast out everyone who does evil.
They will be thrown into the loving prison. Here he will cry and breathe.
"So the people will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear. Tales of the hidden storehouse and the gems."
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and for joy went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
"He said, 'Go and sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.' But
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught all kinds of fish.
When they are full, the fishermen haul them up on the shore, then they sit and gather the good fish into bags. But they throw away the bad fish.
This is how the Day of Judgment will be. Ghosts will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The sick will be cared for in the loving environment. Here they will weep and breathe.
"Can you understand all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished his gesture. Then he moved on.
Kyrt returned to his exalted place. Here he began to study humans in their mosques. They were delighted. "Who was studying this man? Who had the power to do such deeds?" they asked.
Isn't this the son of Mary? What is his mother's name, Mary? And his brothers, Jesus, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They never accepted him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
She could perform a little magic, but they didn't believe.
John the Baptist's head on a platter
At that time Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, heard about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. Rise from the earth! And this is the reason he can do miracles."
Herod seized John. He bound him and threw him into prison for the sake of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was telling Herod, "You must not take her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. And Herod was greatly pleased with her.
She guaranteed it with a promise that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother completed the sentence for her. The girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was affected. But he remembered his promises and the guests at the dinner. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was placed on a large plate and presented to the girl. Then the girl carried his head to her mother.
She learned once, and she learned once, and she learned once, and she learned once, and she learned once, and she learned...
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went by boat to a secluded area. The people found out what had happened and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had great compassion on them. He healed the sick people.
As evening approached, the Muslims called out to him. "There's nothing here," they said. "It's getting late. Send the people out. They can go and buy food in the villages."
He replied: "They don't have to leave. Give them something to eat."
"We only have five pieces of bread and a can of fish," they replied.
"Bring them to me," he said.
Then Jesus sent the people to sit on the grass. He took five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
Both of them ate and forgot. They forgot 12 baskets of the remainder.
The number that the men ate was about 5000. And the women and children ate. Jesus walked on water.
Quickly Jesus summoned the disciples to get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, to the shore of Lake Galilee. Then he dismissed the crowds.
Then he didn't send them, he just climbed a mountain to wait. And when night fell, he was alone.
The wing was battered by the shore. The waves were striking it because the winds were hitting it.
Early in the morning, Jesus went out to the workers. He walked on the lake.
"He walked on the lake and fell through," they said. "Go away!" they cried, trembling with fear.
Quickly Jesus said to them: "Be of good cheer! I am. Do not be afraid."
"My lord, are you there?" asked Petro. "If you are, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Quickly, Jesus dropped his hand and withdrew it. "Confidence is so important!" he said. "Why did you recoil?"
When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They passed by the lake and reached Genessaret.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding region. People sent all their sick to Jesus.
They would ask him to allow those who were sick to touch the edge of his clothes. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "clean"?
Some of the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come to Jerusalem saw Jesus, and they asked him questions.
Why don't you listen to what the elder teaches? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Yusef replied, "And what about God's teaching? Please soften your teaching!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and also said, "He who curses his father or mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to tell their parents, "Any help you receive from us is a gift dedicated to God."
So they are due the honor of their people for their virtue. You make God's words void in order to adhere to your instructions.
You are all deniers! Isa is more worthy of your promise. He said:
People respect me by saying so, but their hearts have belittled me.
The worship they perform does not concern me; they teach nothing useful except the rules of men. (Isaiah 29:13)
David said, "Listen and understand."
What enters your mouth does not satisfy you, what satisfies you is what comes out of your mouth.
Then the woman came to me and asked, "Do you know why the Pharisees were astonished when they heard this?"
Jesus replied, "There are other plants my Father has allowed to grow. They are the ones he will gather into his barn."
Get rid of them. The Pharisées are gloomy travelers. If one gloomy person leads another gloomy person, they will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you understand yet?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart. That's what defiles you.
Evil actions come from the heart, including murder, adultery, sexual crimes, theft, false witness, and lying about people.
"This is what makes you whole. But breaking yourself without washing your hands doesn't make you whole." - "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee, and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A woman from Canaan lived near Tire and Sidon. She came to Jesus and cried out, "Man of God! Son of David! Have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She suffers terribly."
Jesus didn't say anything. So I called him. They asked him, "Send her. She's still screaming."
Yeshua replied, "I was sent only to the Jews. They are like lost sheep."
Then the nation fell to its knees. "Surrender! Help me!" she said.
He said, "It is not right to take children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Of course, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Jesus answered and said to her, "Woman, you have great faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus walked on the Sea of Galilee. Then he went to a mountain in the middle of the region.
Large crowds would come at night, bringing blind people, people with disabilities, people with speech impairments, and many others. He would place them on His feet and heal them.
The people thought. Those who could not speak began to talk. Those who were sick became well. Those who could not walk began to walk. Those who were blind began to see. So the people gave thanks to God, who is called Israel.
So Jesus said to his disciples, "I have great compassion on this crowd, for they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?"
How many loaves do you have? asked Jesus. "Seven, and a few fish," they replied.
Jesus said to the people, "Make peace on earth."
He took the seven loaves, gave thanks, and broke them, then gave them to the disciples to set before the people.
Both of them ate and forgot. Then, the Muslim took seven balls from the rest.
The amount eaten by men is 4000. Women and children ate too.
Then Josus sent the group away and left, leaving Salou in the boat, and went to an area near Magadan.
They asked Jesus for a spectacular sign.
The Persians and the Medes contacted Cyrus to test him. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
He said, "You look at the sky in the evening and say, 'The weather will be good, the sky is red'."
And today you say, "It will rain today, the sky will be red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky, but you do not understand the signs that are happening now.
An unclean and unruly people were seeking an unclean sign. But what was given to them was only the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus left them and went away. The sign that spread among the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The students passed by in the middle. They forgot their cloak.
"Learn," Jesus told them. "Learn from the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
The students spoke among themselves then. They said, "He must be lying because we didn't bring any bread."
Yussif knew what they were talking about. He said, "You rascals! Why are you talking to each other about the absence of bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five reasons for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you collected?
Do you remember what seven is enough for 4000 tiles? Do you remember how many baskets of pieces you collected?
How can you understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not talking about literal bread. He was warning them about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declared that Jesus was the Messiah.
Jesus withdrew to the region of Caesarea Philippi. And he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what about you? he asked. Who do you say I am?
Simon Peter replied: "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus advised his disciple not to write to anyone that Jesus is the Messiah. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that time, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He said to them, "I am going to be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn me to death. They will hand me over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and on the third day he will be raised again."
Peter cleared Jesus aside and started to rebuke him. "No, Lord!" he said. "This shall not happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
If he doesn't clear himself, he clears himself. But if he doesn't clear himself for my sake, he clears himself.
How can a child have an action that breaks it with the child? Or what breaks it for the child?
The faithful son will be a joy to his parents, a sign of their blessing. The faithful son will be a joy to his own children. And I will give to each according to his deeds.
What I am telling you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus' appearance is changing.
Seven days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And his appearance was transformed before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter Lysis said, "My lord, he is with us here. If you wish, I will build three mosques. One for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
She was speaking to Peter, and a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly afraid. They fell to the ground on their faces.
But Jesus called out to them, "Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid."
When they had opened it, they saw the letter was written to him from Jesus.
She was coming down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why did the teachers say that Elijah comes first?"
Jesus replied, "This is true. The Spirit will come and renew all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will they do to the Son of Man.
Then those who followed him realized that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, have mercy on my son."
"God," he said, "restore my son. He trembles and spreads. He falls often into fire or into water."
Your students brought him to me. But they couldn't heal him.
"You are the generation of vipers!" answered Jesus. "How long shall I bear with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring me the child."
Jesus commanded the demon to leave the boy, and it departed from him. And he was healed immediately.
So the woman came and told Jesus privately, "Why can't we cast out demons?"
He said, "Because your faith is very simple. What I am telling you is true. If your faith is as simple as an olive seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They gathered in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
They will kill him. On the third day he rises from the dead. Then the city became famous for its mourning. Jesus pays the temple taxes.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received the temple tax came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Surely, he does," Peter replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" He asked. "Who collects taxes and royal duties on earth? Does he collect them from his own sons or from others?"
"No one else," Peter replied. "Then the sons don't pay," Jesus said to him.
But we don't want to make them laugh. Go to the lake and lower your chain. Choose the flag you find. Open its mouth. We'll find the stomach we need. Choose it and copy it to them from my necessity and my necessity.
