And you are suffering from hunger.
Do you eat or not?
No, I'll eat.
Let me know, shall I accept it?
Your husband is eager to kiss you.
I'm tired of him.
This is an opportunity for us; our cars are surprisingly old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These matters are common and widespread.
Simplify! He lacks self-confidence.
Ah, scary?
What really bothers me
Is he the one who manages the budget?
What project is he managing?
This is a massive government project.
He is tested at the bottom.
I have the right to receive money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Mother, how could I forget!
And today in vehicles
Which means "I will" in
I consider myself a participant!
It's not fair that I don't benefit from it.
Will I get something?
This means I'm involved too.
Let's assume that each of us takes.
This is a government project.
But your foolish son won't understand.
I will talk to him.
The good that you reject.
This is a government project.
This is an opportunity for you.
As others do.
The financial party is in front of you.
Taking your advice.
He only had one real in his hand.
I heard it from myself.
Government projects are known to...
And the last third is theft.
"Abey salom" translates to "Hello" or "Hi" in English.
I go to Souq Waqif.
The cost of one of the lights was twenty riyals.
They kept it secret in the budget.
Each person has one hundred and eighty riyals.
They said we didn't do anything wrong.
You will harm him.
Rejoice in Christ from Satan.
Yes, but I think he's changing his mind.
God willing, my Lord.
He is the chairman of the board and everything is in his hands.
Above all, don't forget us.
We are your friends.
We need to be together.
This government project is an opportunity.
"Of course, sir! Ali."
We can't do it without you.
Don't worry, Ali.
And if God wills, everyone who joins the project will succeed.
Of course
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
From your side
Don't worry because you are members of the project committee.
Are you worried about Salim, the project manager?
They say that
Don't worry, Ali.
And tell your friends not to worry.
Are we really, Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
But, Saad, don't forget.
No, no
Since everything will work out fine.
I agree with this. Surrender first.
I'll take care of him.
I was wondering if I would get some benefit.
Is it possible?
Therefore, you are involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is that it remains a secret between us.
And you found a bowl of rice and meat in front of you.
Certainly I will.
Enjoy your meal.
What's wrong with you!
If you stay idle like this,
This doesn't work.
This is what doesn't work.
Or questions
We will cooperate with you.
How do we get our participation?
Or is it logical?
What's his name?!
We're not the only ones who are moving.
Each participant will request their participation.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Sallem.
We are finalizing the budget.
What's the story with the land he bought today?
Did he find it as well?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this data?
Call me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's the problem?"
Go to your brother.
The other forehead
That is next to the land I bought yesterday.
Approved for sale.
He said: "Call him and ask him what he wants, I'll keep it for his benefit."
He doesn't want him to share the money with us.
What does our money mean?
We are considered participants with him.
Even if we didn't participate!
It breaks your heart every time.
At least give your brother and mother some.
I'm not asking you to be here.
We also participate in the project, and we have the right to request our projects.
Tell her, tell her.
It is true that Sultan came and asked him to join him, but he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You should give him a share in the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him talking to them.
They allow their brother and friend to enter.
I know that government projects are open to everyone.
We don't want a limited amount of money and be done.
I'm from the capital.
His brother, the Sultan, can attend committee meetings if he wishes.

But we want to
Thank you.
Sure, I'll ask him.
Your brother!
You will love him.
The project will benefit.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, didn't we?
You, O Ladder
I'll be responsible for the concrete, bricks, and mortar.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Hello people!
Set/take your hooks.
I swear,
Sometimes I decide to collect a sum of money,
And sometimes I say
I get a commission.
No problem, okay, no problem.
Use your preferred method and get what you want.
The most important thing,
We, too,
Therefore, during this week,
Everyone determines the amount of money they want to have.
For example
And after a few days, they change their minds.
He asked for an additional hundred thousand.
Undoubtedly, but why is that, eh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on committing a theft, and ignore him.
There are also the funds of the Muslims.
More budget.
Many people want to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What is this! My father's project?!
Yes, he is a sultan.
Oh! My brother! Oh! Sultan
That is, he is a participant.
Is that the last name?
My friend Saud lists a large number of names.
He continues to add names, saying, "Let's benefit from them."
So, in which group do I add it, percentage or cash amount?
No, give it to those in need.
%pw How much should you allocate to him! Allocate twenty thousand to him.
Yes, enough.
So they add a note here that says
He is our ally.
But Saad's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of it will be considered part of the Phase One budget.
As a package, no one will notice.
Yes, there is a list, and there is a list that my mother sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without asking.
Haha, I wish you a long life.
The apple is in my eye, my son.
God bless you, %pw is sick and poor.
But the lady has no money.
May God bless you, I told you this is the last one.
Inform him that the procedure is a liver transplant.
What? Yes, wait, wait... How much is enough for you?
How much is enough for the liver, accommodation, and hospital?!
About one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How much liver do you transplant!
One, but her brothers are expensive.
Yes, God bless you, I'll put her name on the list.
Hassina, yes yes Hassina, she's a good girl.
Do you give her from your money?!
Reassure him and tell him that I didn't take anything from phase two.
Yes, yes, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Oh! Man, they'll replace her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughter.
One thousand twenty
Write for me
Yes, Hassina is a good girl.
Could I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No mother.
I simplified a large amount of work.
I'll call you later.
The people who ate from the dinner increased.
The infrastructure is capable of handling the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
This is on your shoulders.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say that you deserve a million.
They decide that the project starts tomorrow.
And we will be paid installments continuously.
How much! We want to know!
They will give it all to her at once or in full.
Why does she take more than us?
Whether it's an electrical threat or a robbery threat, it doesn't matter, the most important thing is that we stay quiet, waiting for them to come.
He told you to stop talking, so you stopped talking.
Do not hit.
If you hear someone speaking
I will shut his mouth.
Keep a long time for us.
You know this is money, not something easy or simple.
How long ago was it?
Fifty million
It seems you're eating a big burger.
You are a leader after all.
We don't want a headache.
We decide the budget.
Mr. Saleh, through your presentation about the project, we noticed that it is a very vital and operational project.
And this is not the only time.
Yes, yes
Tomorrow is the inauguration of the first phase of the project.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you once again.
And I receive
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
Where are we then!
I don't know where we are.
I'm tired of this.
Do not see that the scholars said and the people insisted that they were?
Will you be at the official opening?
Come on, speak now, I mean we are in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people are equal.
And these sections, I don't know what they put inside them.
Leave the box intact.
These departments are the infrastructure.

Third birthday, what's wrong with you?
I really don't know.
Yes, thank God, aging is a disease.
I wish I knew why I was fired.
He just parks his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when you told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it, there's a big farm.
Thank God, you're comfortable.
You receive your bills when you're comfortably at home.
When you speak, my love, don't let anyone pass through your mind, Munira.
God bless you, Munira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
Whoever is concerned about your involvement and passes it on.
Ah, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Her sons don't give her a single riyal from their father's inheritance.
We work the same way.
This is your legitimate right.
This is a matter of trust... Trust us!
I don't know.
I'm not satisfied with what my brother Rashid said.
He reminds me every time to check their examination that is given to me every three months.
But, this is my right.
He always tells me.
Don't trust us.
Financial matters and heirs must be clear.
If you, beloved, are not satisfied
You know what he does to people.
"And the two gardens, one to the right and the other to the left, are but a trial for you, that you may be tested as to whether you are grateful or ungrateful."
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Criticism destroys people.
But actions are actions, and it's your legitimate right.
And then what?
He manages the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
Without problems or tension
She said she was passing by a place in the desert.
This is enough for her.
I'm afraid that her husband, Nassor, is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister has started searching.
This is the problem.
She plans to put us in trouble.
This is sort of like we're giving her money.
Calm Saker.
We need a solution to this problem, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance.
The assistance they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
Four thousand is enough.
As if they aren't implementing the amount.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Known
Clarifying
They said, "Let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking."
Sure, everything you said is true.
They give me a little at a time.
If you see their wives
Contains many jewels made of different diamonds.
And I don't own half of what he owns.
They don't feel I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it.
This is your right.
Legal and lawful right
I feel like they're stealing from me and denying it.
I don't feel comfortable with their behavior.
Life is unpredictable, my dear!
They exhaust me, drag me along, dear!
Don't they know there is a judgment and a punishment?
And that God will punish them for their misappropriation of people's money.
And you, be careful, don't tell them anything about the court, dear!
They will be happy.
Is it due to our population density?
That's why I'm telling you, dear!
Stop and work.
Everyone has an apartment that looks like a tall building.
I just want my right.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
"And intentionally use the surveyor for surveying."
Mother of Silmi
Keep calm, my dear!
And do not mention to them anything about the city.
Or anything else
Know Massa!
At this moment
I'll get her rights back.
You were wondering about the accountant.
Who are you!! To wonder about it
Answer them!
Sure, I... No, no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Do not let them remain.
Do you know which door I entered from?
No, no
No sorrow.
It's sad, Saad.
What will Nora get into trouble for?
If you want to partner with us in the company and real estate, we don't mind.
A million times.
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure he's her bad husband.
As she is loving.
As if I'm asking them.
This is a known, clear, and legitimate law.
Either he tells me to take 600,000 or nothing.
It is not fair.
Expect anything, Munira!
My father's company.
Four buildings
Without mentioning lands and houses
He says only six hundred thousand.
By signing the renunciation document
No way! Monira
Don't be fooled, spread this document, be aware, you are authorized.
It is your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else, and it is not their responsibility.
But the company,
You are a partner.
You were fired from the company.
No one can hold me back.
I know what?
Is it your father's company?
You don't hear him screaming.
Let me in, I tell you.
Keep it, no need.
He has a paper that I don't know what it is.
This is shouting at us, let it sleep.
We're sorry.
My brother Saad sent to the management and explained to them what they know.
Enter within me.
"Employ whoever needs it, so they can break something."
Come on, let's go.

Gets you into trouble
He will discover how much she owned.
He will discover that we deserve four hundred thousand instead of forty thousand for her.

In 96 months,
Here's the problem, put it at three hundred and sixty.
Ten million five hundred thousand
No problem, so what?
Let him do what he can.
I'll say it outright.
This is our money.
All his heirs received the same thing.
Hello, welcome to your company, don't worry about what happened.
Welcome
Here is accountant Samir.
Reply to any question Mr. Nasser might ask.
The entire company is under your control.
If you want to come in, don't hesitate, don't ask for permission for anything.
Thank you.
I count on you.
Go get it, take it.
So, it looks at all the files.
Supposed to take more than ten million.
It wasn't even mentioned.
Balaash used to say
That her father left.
Four buildings
I thought they owned three lands.
Every land is greater than the other.
God suffices us for all things, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, O son!
What he's doing is unfair.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Umm Salama?
I need to file a lawsuit against them, there's no other option.
He will go through some documents.
The case is adjourned.
Beware, my father, O companion!
Never talk about the court.
Hello, madam, you are here and a doctor is looking for you.

Go to your room.

Sorry, who's speaking?
Oh, now I remember you, yes, yes, I remember you.
Yes, yes, yes, yes
For something, brother!
Don't worry, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's working like crazy.
Do you think this is Abdullah who they sent to us?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, because she was years ago.
Do you believe Monira?
Even Abdullah, give me some advice.
Follow them and ascribe to them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take as much of it as you can.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
Not suitable for people who live seventy or eighty years.
This is for those who will live at least a hundred years.
Salma, may Allah keep her safe.
God have mercy on her, she used to say.
Our population did not exceed 400,000.
And the case will take ten years, perhaps more.
Do we need to be sworn in for them to accept it in court?
This is it.
Yes, man, do you sit with them?
I will please you.
Since he's an old school friend.
Life is short.
And I ask you for your own good.
And you come from a large and famous family.
From deep roots.
I hope, Rashid, that we are friends.
Please go while I'm still in danger.
Or you will see it whispered.
Get out, and forget the whole thing. Friendship simplifies it.
Are you going out or not?
Paid one hundred thousand nights for a dark-type jewelry package from the Jewelry Exhibition.
Where did you get all this money from?
They spend money on their wives.
And diminishes the wealth of her sisters.
Do you have hope, Nasser?!
"So fight in the way of God."
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you.
Famous and long-standing people
Maybe, why not?
But, I also suggest
May God repeat this conversation with these bright faces.
O Allah, make our hearts shine with goodness for our worldly life and our Hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say other than the matter of my sister's involvement.
This is true.
It is preferable that you go or you will be punished.
I don't care what you say.
I've asked for months, and you refused.
I don't care.
I will go tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her.
You won't go to court.
The day after tomorrow
We'll let you see what you'll do.
Goodbye
Kindness does not benefit them.
And they realized that their reputation was at stake.
We'll find out what they decide.
Sad, will you finish today?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, so we can go to it tomorrow.
What is this?
You are right.
He asked him why.
What you want goes to court and criticizes us.
To prove your ownership as an heir to the inheritance.
Yes, I did.
Make your life satisfying.
Your life is complete.
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
When you arrive, park your car in the designated parking area.
You will see the security guards.
You go to the eighth grade.
The judges are on this floor.
Business cards for all the lawyers in the country.
I'm sure you'll need them.
They came here to mock us.
We want to start a legal proceeding against us.
Go to court.
Listen, Munir.
Provide us with a waiver document.
"Which are go
You know the way.
We showed you the way.
Go together, brother.
I forgot to give Munira something important.
This is today's Al-Raya newspaper.
There is a very good article.
It was written by a woman, I think she's a doctor.
I want you to look, as a gift *from me*
His life situation must be changed.
Manufactured to the highest standards.
He has four children, but his house is spacious.
It will certainly spread, he lost all his money.
Taking risks in this project.
What I don't expect to start a project is Bou and Walid.
Eat, eat, the sons of the new investor, Bou and Walid.
My darling, would you like me to get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Rise and shine, get some fruit.
Mom, I want Hamood's toy.
Enjoy your meal, enjoy your meal.
My son Waleed put some sweets for your brother.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Waleed, you deserve it!
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
Father, if we were progressive merchants, I would want to have a private room of my own.
Look what he was asked, he has no dreams, my dear son.
Sure, I'll give you a big bunch of blue berries.
Forget their desires now.
As all people
Instead of our small, cramped house.
First, let's pay off all our debts, then we'll see.
You look very happy, Bou Walid.
He eats more than before.
He is experienced, and his luck is good.
All my father's hair is gray.
Best wishes to the framework.
Keep some for my friend.
If God wills, God bless you.
I met a Japanese man, I was part of them.
When we were seated, he switched places with him and presented me with a catalog as a gift.
After that, one of my friends saw that.
He said: "This is an opportunity."
Multi-purpose spaces?
He always likes this.
These are computer centers.
Click on the cinema.
If you want a playground...
This is magic.
They were amazed, they all said yes.
I took from the bank, and part of my family, I sold my land, thank God.
Since the committee agreed,
When you asked her from the office, did he agree to delegate her?
An email will be sent to the factory then.
He will call you when he arrives.
There is thyme tea.
Nothing, I'm still waiting at Ali's office.
And the accelerator is connected, finally.
And you'll be back in ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
The committee acknowledged its efforts.
Why did you expect that?
Are you not a fully authorized administrator?
Why don't you go move there to represent you, %pw?
I told you he can't.
It's not limited to him; all the workers there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving at times.
You must thank God.
I was there looking for the signature, and I was nervous.
Are you finished?
How can I finish this if Boo Fhad never shows up?
What can I do?
After that, I will waste my money.
I want him to sign immediately so it's done, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I am waiting for myself.
She says that as she is responsible for it, what about us?
And give me your mobile number.
It's not the accelerator, sit down, sit down, it's not his, what's the problem?
Don't scare people, they used to believe it was the apocalypse.
No, we're still waiting for Boo Fhad.
%pw, My money that was used to fix the bathroom.
This is distant.
Hello people, wait, wait
Frankly, honestly,
He told you to stay quiet, enough, shut up.
Bu Fahad had to go out to the airport.
How did he leave?
Let's see her by the car before he leaves.
What's wrong with him?
In the name of God, he seeks your mercy.
Wait for Bu Fahad.
Don't punish your father, dear.
But it's being spent in a strange way.
And if he does not get the commodity,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now you need her.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
This is here, in front of you.
You call me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
This is beyond my control, my daughter.
I know my father, but he's not fair.
Classes start next week at the university.
If I don't enroll, I'll have to wait until next semester.
Three months would mean a waste of time.
Oh! Dear, I'm trying.
Don't you see that I go to the ministry every day?
Wait until Bou Fahad comes, Bou Fahad.
And he will stay at my house.
Don't understand!
Don't miss dinnertime.
This is the fourth time you've sued me.
Are you crazy?
I know you need criticism.
But, hopefully Boo will sign the documents this week.
And the first installment will be given to him.
I don't know what to say to you, sister.
Wakes up anxious.
He sleeps and talks to himself all night.
If Boo Fahd doesn't sign
In the name of God, He protects.
Therefore
Boo Fahad must sign this document this week.
What is he waiting for?
He comes to work once.
And a year passes.
And leave people's comfort.
Oh oh oh oh oh, how does it happen?
Do you feel better now?
Destroy me completely
This strange fever attracts me, attracts me.
What does he want?
I heard that I'm going to the ministry.
To complete my documents
Inform the workers that I will punish them.
And the time period will soon end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
This is Boo's secretary.
I want to tell you that
He will definitely bring a cheetah tomorrow.

Ten-digit numbers on the printout sheets

The manager punishes him.
By bringing him with us
Have you heard of the factory?
He will lose his money if they don't sign his documents today.
If he goes, the manager will recognize him.
God, yes, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll deal with that, just let it go.
Bu Waleed
I'll go, but I'm expecting a phone call.
Notify me
In the name of God, He protects.

He prepared it.
And I waited for him.
Give thanks to Allah and consider your father.
Now it's your turn.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants rest.
You've tired this Sunni out.
When he returned,
He was tired.
Don't bother me with their affairs (sings)
Don't bother me with their affairs (sings)
I wanted to take these documents to the bank on my way to work.
He explained that those who are late will be penalized.
Certainly, my dear.
Go to your work.
With this nose, and those small Chinese eyes, welcome.
Bossy
He sends you to a place every day.
As You Like It, Mother of Saeed
He smells a scent.
This is in my nose.
Coward, coward
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, my father, invent it for the market branch.
And teach them there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there if they're telling me he's not here.
Sure, hello.
I got sunburned.
The sun has arrived.
I entered the neighbor's house.
The lady recognized me.
She asked me what the problem was.
What drives you to do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat kunafah now.
Mom, where's Dad?
From exchange and return
She didn't tell him which bank to go to.
Inform him that some documents are missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the principal.
How is my father now, does he feel better?
I slept a little, and the headache is gone now.
I tell you in front of him.
Leave your father, let him sleep.
Are they happy or sad?
They must commit to their work, they will move on to an evaluation, what can they do?
As you wish.
"I will explain in two parts."
You could say I stopped, but I didn't stop.
How does it happen?
Before, in the past,
Misery is presented to me.
Your children are already completely grown up.
I need to help them.
They were telling me.
You are wrong.
Do you think that all young people without a father don't complete their personal tasks?
Depends on the work.
In some jobs, you are allowed to go out to accomplish your personal work.
By God's mercy, they will be compensated with something better.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind you.
Where are you going, Bushra?
I will complete the documents for my son Saeed.
In this ministry, next to this cafe.
I'll take her to the relevant department.
Goodbye
"The one who doesn't have a mother, well, I'll see you later, Ali."
This won't help you.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
My father is sick.
I don't care about you.
If your father doesn't complain
It's a painkiller.
And he hates it and he hates it.
You've tired him out, fear God.
The very loud voice that was shouting took me as an echo chamber.
Father, you were a government employee and knew very well what "dismissal" meant.
They are writing for the first time.
And now they do this, they do this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Sure, my son.
You believed in his deception.
He says he has a clothing committee tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
%pw, as you wish
Go immediately to finish his work.
Nothing, nothing
He would fall silent upon reaching home.
He doesn't respond to me.
You have no shame.
I don't criticize your father who simplified things for you.
If you agree on this.
Greatly, and may God bless you.
He was supposed to come to you.
Why is Abdu claiming that?
You are dearer to us, Father.
And I am forbidden to you.
Please excuse him.
I'm leaving the *training* to him.
From now on, Father.
And be extravagant.
Drug dealer (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, O father.
May God compensate you with something better.
We've decided from now on,
We will check our documents ourselves.
Thank you all very much, may God reward you with good, thank God.
But please, Father.
I consider him the last.
But I can't.
Call me now.
Father, I won't go to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister will be angry with you.
No, no, no, this is impossible, don't bother the minister, you must go, even before him.
I don't go, Father, what I say, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, and consider them complete.
He'll be on your way when you're done with Saeed's documents.
Please, Father.
I consider it the last leaf you finish for me.
I'm happy to serve you, Father!
But your son is supposed to sign this document.
Do you mean that I come back tomorrow and give it to you?
I recommend that you return it today.
And if they don't see the documents?
You need to wait for two months.
Don't give it to me until he signs it and I'll come back to you.
No, no, no, no need.
Call him and ask him to come, just for two minutes.
I will complete it.
Don't you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And they return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Every time I ask a friend, "Where are you?"
He answers that he is with Saeed.
I'm waiting until the work day is over.
Sure, man.
Why didn't you complete your documents yourself when you were accused?
Why didn't you send your sons?
Do you have any sons?
Are you okay, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
No use.
I will leave you.
And I go to Sheikh Hospital in the later years.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What you tell them, just happy?
I will write something else.
Yes, thank God.
He is a man of yesterday.
I don't deserve to be my sister.
Why are you wasting time?
I told him never to appear on television or radio.
These "stop pollution" conversations haven't brought us any problems.
In the name of Allah, He guides him to the path of righteousness.
Certainly, my servant, hello, congratulations.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent.
What I can tell you
Launch the program called Melas, I think.
He carried on a conversation with the person.
Khalid Jassem
Inform him of the cessation of corruption.
His colleagues hear him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who were encouraging him to do that.
Kept him
In the name of God, He makes the right path easy.
I apologize now because I need to go and cook.
Hello anytime.
Come, my son.
Enjoy yourself here.
End corruption, my son.
I'm tired and fed up with this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve that, Mom.
I'm sorry to hear that happened.
I didn't tell you I wanted to.
What is it, Mother?
And I scream.
This is a commitment.
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
Let's just sleep on it.
Stop corruption.
Why was the principal fired?
This is outrageous, after all these years, you're kicking me out.
You don't listen.
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes, Salah.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow public affairs and offer criticism.
Fully understood
Stop, just stop, stop.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Sure, hello.
The brother greeted.
I wish Monira's father hadn't found out.
It has already been harmful to you.
Who will understand it?
If he asks you
Inform him that I'm working.
I told you they'd fire him, didn't I?
His mother was asked and said that he was still working.
Of course
His mother says today that
What can we do for him now?
We cannot let our daughter go through torment with him.
What you see is a sack.
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to divide my daughter's inheritance.
Drink your coffee.
Don't beat around the bush unless you're thinking of something.
Frankly,
I want to go out.
You have been suspended.
I know you want to
Go to the café.
Your update is illogical.
Go to your room and sleep.
And yesterday morning, you were looking for a job.
If God wills, I will rise early.
Mother, I told you, I've been thinking about this habit.
I swear
Mom, frankly, I feel a bit uncomfortable.
And do not speak with a meaning that contradicts.
Act as if you are deaf.
Change
What's the matter, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking as you used to?
We want to hear some of your conversations about stopping pollution.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Weapon here!
He must be sleeping.
Did my son make any mistakes?
We saw her at the coffee shop.
What did he say?
Do the right thing.
Because there were many people around him.
Just ask for him.
Don't waste your time.
If you see me here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it wasn't your fault.
This is his mistake that he didn't stop with you.
I know you well.
You as a person quit smoking.
Shall we talk or not, shall we have a conversation to stop pollution or not?
I warn you.
If I hear you speaking on a radio program.
Or a weapon to stop forgery.
Salih, you are a good citizen, and you celebrate patriotically.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
We apologize to you.
Hello Sallam, how are you?
I wish you hadn't gone to the trouble of coming, we appreciate it.
It is not really deserved.
I wish every day to hear him, and end corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Say it only once.
In the name of God, I wish you well, me
Is it a cigarette? Just say: "Finish the corruption, please."
He's asking you, confront him, just once.
This is amazing.
Now, friends
For the job
You are a loyal citizen, and very beloved by us.
We wanted to call you to warn you.
He would scare you in public.
Are you serious?
Everyone said there are no jobs.
They really wanted to hire me, but there are no jobs.
And now, how will you save money for yourself and your mother?
And do not forget that
She has four children.
In the name of God, he seeks your mercy.
Do not be absent.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You need to look for a job every day.
Because my father does not harm.
I'll take any job, just for you.
I will never stop pollution again.
Stop the forgery.
You don't know what he's doing today.
I told you.
But you never listen to me.
In the name of God, He guides you.
I cannot go to the minister and inform him of this man's action.
The minister will work.
Certainly, he will consider it in this way.
You are right.
But, this is a serious matter.
We must do something.
They say he will compensate you, you know such a complaint has a great impact.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel that I'm being left out of this.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to exclude him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about the Pollution Pause Ladder?
Lives in my neighborhood.
And that will be managed.
We need your voice.
No basket.
And I love you so much.
Salih is an excellent man.
And I hope it will be soon.
He will return, and we will enjoy hearing his voice.
Even Bou Fahad himself asks about you.
Notify me when it's delivered.
Why did you stop?
I had some issues, some health and psychological problems.
Frankly,
You are inspiring.
It's been a long time since I heard from him.
How amazing it was, please deliver.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about it.
Sallam says he agrees.
No, people, it's really hard.
What's wrong with you?
The man is asking you.
Abu Rahma, I had already stopped.
Why didn't you tell us you were looking for a job?
Sure, this is an opportunity for you.
Ask him and let him hear your voice, and go ahead and ask him about a job the next day.
He will definitely take you.
I want what's best for you.
You know.
Forget it, I'll go to your house.
No, no, no, we never want your help.
Sure %pw Wait, man, let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Surely, surely
Sure, if I speak for the last time now, it means I've stopped, but I'll do it one last time.
What Bo Fahd wants, he hears it?
What problem does he care about? You know, there are many problems here, so many.
What does he like to hear? Or does he prefer chaos, I don't know, tell me.
According to the executed contract.
Use his authority.
Four hundred seven = centimeters
Waste it.
Don't compensate me.
Why did the worker do that?
Where is Volume Seven? Volume Seven.
Don't compensate me.
Sixth, Minister
Why did the worker work?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
Bring your brother's cars.
People, stop corruption.
Now that you're back, we want you to stay connected to the program.
I am a person of love, meaning, this is the last time.
Because frankly, I stopped.
Mom, you said you stopped it, didn't you?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The person who is called the "stop forgery" person, they talked about them on the radio.
I didn't hear it, but some people told me that they did.
I'm sure someone from the ministry leaked it.
It became likely that he would be crowned.
It is available.
Sure, Minister
Don't worry.
My entire day is dedicated to working at a ministry, may God bless you.
Did she hear it?
I only said that so I could
Neglect me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdulrahman informed me that he will give me a ride.
He didn't speak to me.
You are the Almighty, the All-Powerful.
I feel sorry for you.
I am Secret Bou Fahad
And I know the problem.
Use you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they reached him.
Do you know who improved all this?
The neighbor is late.
He was behind all of that.
Bu Fahad will never hire you.
You will do the same thing for him.
Since you're known.
No one hires you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow, for divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Consistent with any problem
No, we don't do that.
We don't have any problems at all.
We are happy.
What is family preference?
Everyone stands in line.
Because that's the system here.
Give him his rights more than the foreigner.
We do not rely on foreigners.
We don't have that.
Your effort and work make you the best, we have no problems.
Or an important member
And I burn you.
We don't have this here.
As for me
Salih Rashid Saad Rashid Ali Bahri
Known for stopping forgery
I don't want to eat dinner.
I was running and Adoul, a police officer, pulled me over.
He is eager for you to wear a new crown.
Walid was seen wearing the shirt we bought from Villaggio.
He took him by his love and separated him.
He is loving, he does not deny.
I think
You, Adol, saw my son revealing and you were disturbed by his teaching.
It does not fall on his shoulders.
Why did you break Walid's promise?
I saw him wearing new shorts and got jealous, ask your dad to buy you a new one.
What do you think?
What caused Walid's police force to be divided?
I'm telling you
Don't force you to escalate.
Sultan, my brother.
Why don't you punch him in the face and turn him around?
He is a small child, not your age, be afraid of yourself.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
People need to be elevated and corrected.
Not limited to the left
Be careful with your words, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, to patronize me.
You are multifaceted.
Bestow good upon him.
And if you cannot do that
I respect him.
I don't want to deny it in front of his wife.
And my brothers
If Walid is accused again,
I will punish him.
It's me who's wasting my time arguing with you.
Answer yourself.
Give me leave to go and show it to her.
Souls with burdens
Where are the past days?
The intention is clear.
Spare us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this is the biggest one.
Leave everything and join now
Connect and see the difficulties we're going through.
Yes, but dear, tell me what happened.
Ahmed, I'm sorry, I have to go home. There's an emergency and I must go.
Sakinah was handed a knife.
This is a misleading person and is accused of hate.
To him... He is a sultan.
How did the child cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I did not use them, God is sufficient.
I will show it to him.
Set, listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't confess, he'll say it's the child.
So, what do we do?
Father, do you know how to assemble a carousel?
Yes, I know.
The hand, my dear
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
Where did you put the pieces, my dear?
Under his bed.
They destroyed him, may God destroy their lives.
But I'll show it to him.
I will remain broad-minded.
This is crazy, crazy.
Because now.
Do not exceed it.
But the computer is something else, I'll show it to him.
I will remain broad-minded.
Do you think our son Adoul is the one who caused the damage to their device?
Ask him to come, let's find out who's behind this.
Do not
Go mock someone else, maybe your friends, not me.
I told you they were those.
Look at someone else, Panther, not me.
Ugh, move that.
The hearts were loving.
The intention is clear.
Is there a child?
I don't go to find friends.
Mockery of me, not by me, O Sultan!
I will deny him.
Keep the scissors sharp.
Respond with your actions.
Hello, Abdurrahman, hurry up, son!
I'm available to look after your brothers, Fahad and Sultan.
They fight every day, son!
I don't know.
At this meeting,
We remain.
Engage in careful reflection on our actions.
And the actions of the people who were sold to us.
We are seen.
It will be a lesson for us.
Let's benefit from them.
Don't behave like children.
As if he were big, as if he were a camel.
Has sons
Without prior knowledge
You are the ones who are moving, not them.
His model is his father.
You, O Sultan
And you, Fahd
I am your older brother.
Because we
I'll make him pay for the computer.
You shook his hand.
You haven't forgiven each other.
No, his hands only trembled to escape.
"From the hadith of Abdurrahman on infinity."
Where are you going?
I swear I'll stay with him.
Have you tried that tea?
Go away, don't hide.
Open the door, if you are a man.
Didn't you say Abdelrahman agreed with you?
But, I swear if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
I'll show him, keep the tea.
On his head
Stop, stop, be done with it, you children, they have no shame, they're hitting each other.
You're acting like two little children, stop it, my son!
I swear to introduce you to him.
Hit him, hit him, my son, a large amount of bomb.
Blood, mother
I was startled by your voice.
Welcome God
Leave us alone.
This is a retardant.
Even if I unite you with each other.
He won't leave you.
When he came at night to visit them
He had no time, daughter!
"What's wrong with him?"
Provided that God wills it.
Speaks fluently
But, my daughters
In the name of God, He guides you.
You must calm them down.
Do not encourage them to fight among themselves, my daughters.
What happened, I hope it's good.
You've ruined me, Abdurrahman.
I wanted you to help me, not do the same thing.
You are the wise brother, O son, may God guide you.
Two well-woven baskets
Spread your arms.
"It has done you harm, and you are the ones who will be guided by God."
The neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Oh! Brother, we've told him many times.
Don't believe him, Amany.
They were throwing rocks, three of them.
I excuse you.
Do not
Prepare my spear, I saw them *from my rival*
Did you hear him?
This means it's too far away.
My brother was truthful when he said she was honest.
I apologize, now that it's done, your children won't do it again.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello, my brother, hello.
The officer, how will you send them, I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in front of them.
Abu Rahma, the elder brother
He is the assistant to the deputy.
The one in the middle is the head of a public body.
Take two Panadol tablets and stay hydrated.
Panadol! Officer.
Do you have a Panadol here?
In the name of Allah, indeed, Allah will suffice for the rivals.
In the name of Allah, indeed, Allah will suffice for the rivals.
In the name of God, God is sufficient against the enemy, you made me thirsty.
What is this?
Every child is attributed to this distance!
This is a man's hand, it looks like his father's.
Do you believe that?
He seems to be from a respectable family, polite and respectful.
That's because I come from a poor family.
So what?
He follows you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And bother you
And you say that you didn't have the opportunity.
When you passed by, you looked at me, what does that mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You shook your head, and she shook hers at the same time.
No, but there's definitely something.
I notice when you enter.
She feels happy at heart.
Go and ask her about a pen.
Wrap it back up.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than it should be.
God, we are in the twenty-first century.
You're really in a crisis.
Frankly
It's been a long time since we've sat and talked like this.
No, here's the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
But you have to go and live now.
Especially after yesterday's fire session in the desert.
We were tired, long hours, I informed the accelerator that I didn't want any media or TV interviews, nor contracts.
I want to spend time with my family.
In the name of God, he seeks your mercy.
Even if you're busy.
The first thing that came to my mind
I know the owner's number, I'll call him today.
Late for something?
The villa is now sold and the buyers have moved in shortly after.
She was keeping herself busy with the series and photography.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them, we will not interfere.
A blessed ascension, O brothers.
What's the problem?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
By God's mercy, it can be obtained from you.
At any time, my brothers.
Peace be upon you
Wael is correct.
Sure, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby to visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Sure, enough already, man.
Took him
What is your full name?
Rashid Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your parents.
My sister is healthy.
I was very happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is my next-door neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is polite and well-liked.
Neighbors precede the house.
I want to take a picture with him.
My colleagues can believe in me.
He couldn't believe our house was next to the actor Raheed Abdullah's house.
I talk to him until he believes.
What a life!
The one we used to see on TV.
And I want to see him.
Our neighborhood has become vibrant, thank God, thank you God!
If they need a ship to sail, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but guys, please calm down with me, I still don't master it very much.
Have you heard of him?
That was a favor from Him, that Allah might take him into His mercy.
Peace be upon you
It has been confirmed that some employees will be transferred to the ministry's new branch in Dukhan.
Did they tell you who was moving?
I didn't hear the names.
But, what I heard and confirmed
Was Boo Ali among them?
My name!
But, we don't exactly know who to transfer.
I can't go, God bless you, smoke is too far for me, I can't.
Whether you can or you can't, this is human work.
The committee is still considering this matter.
But if they chose you
Thank you for visiting, little cow, choose.
Thank you, thank you, Bou Ali.
Please excuse us, the furniture is old.
We live as neighbors today.
We'll be like a family.
That's polite of you, sir! Welcome, Waleed.
I'm ashamed, may God replace you with something better, Abu Walid.
I am greatly interested in the quality of your beauty.
May God keep this love forever.
But, my daughter
I'm ready to look around the market for you until you find beautiful furniture at a good price.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We must change it.
Provided that God wills it.
I told you before.
If you need something
Consider me your sister.
I don't cry for you (export)
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to warn her when she invited me yesterday.
No, because it tires you out.
Do not increase.
I'll call you later, hello.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, and we don't compare to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Wait just a moment.
Wait just a moment.
And I will give you permission to submit it to me.
I told you.
No, mother, don't worry.
And you will come and ask me to propose to you.
I set the dinner in the living room.
If you want to eat
The driver will take her to the university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
Whose car is this?
And soon, if God wills.
I called to thank her.
Good people love good.
Yes, you're right, Dad!
Even our own people don't do that to us.
Absolutely! Is my name on the list?
Are you sure?
Why do problems keep praying on us?
I don't know, I'm confused now, but I heard this news, what should I do, I don't know.
Go, go, go, go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you
What happened, Boo Ali?
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will move to Duhan.
My name is listed.
I'm talking to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think he will help, Ali's mother, I don't think he will help.
I spoke to him, he said no.
Famous actor
I thought your name was never on the list.
In your name, many thanks, Basma!
If you're not bothering anyone.
I want to take a picture with you and show it to my son and daughter.
My sons will be happy.
God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Certainly, God bless you.
I suffer, I suffer
Certainly, I'd be happy to help.
You and whom you love
Notify me two or three days in advance.
Mom, prepare
Ready? Ready for something?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?
She said she didn't care.
I will cling to his example.
Go to them.
But, my son!
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
It should be fashionable.
I don't have distinctive clothes.
You've put me in a problem.
When you take all these gems, this is the first time I've seen you do that.
It doesn't suit me.
Mother of Ali
Umm Ali will serve her son.
You want some high-end clothes and jewelry.
You want to show them that they are expansive and rich people.
(Surprise) God willing
Open to her
If God wills, is this my wife? She is taller and more *slender*.
Insha'Allah, listen.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You must be prepared as well.
They will ask you if they deserve it with their father.
Absolutely, I don't go with this outfit.
When I enter with my new clothes
Mom, take care of her device.
She is very polite, and she gave you her money, so use it wisely.
Yes, yes
So we must be like them.
Why didn't his mother go to present him?
That was for the girls.
I must go and meet the men.
As you can see, God blesses you.
Look at what's left, may God bless you.
Good people, touch me.
They were helpful, just a bit busy.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the look.
All the people stand by your side.
Yes, but, my brother Rashid, am I supposed to soften it like this, or should I keep it?
No, pay attention, first.
You need to tie this.
It defines me.
The garment (the men's garment) is open, but
God bless you.
The left hand should be in...
The right hand is open, just like it.
The lower ship is loaded.
Wow, wow
How amazing it was.
You should slow your steps a bit.
Oh! PW, yes.
Now you look like an angel of angels.
What they offered you, well, other times.
Taking your left hand, like this, the left one, like this.
Do you know I'm honest?
What do you have with you?
You know what she was telling me earlier today.
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to be apart."
I'll ask my brother to suggest something to you.
Tell your friend not to ask his brother and not to harm himself or his brother.
I see that many callers are interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Suwad wanted you for her husband, and today, he wants you for his brother.
They want to take my beloved.
As I sit and watch
Don't they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
Sure, then.
From tomorrow, they will know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I am screaming.
My son Walid is rejected.
The shareholders are more honest than you, O liar! Hypocrite!
But you
They practice throughout your whole life.
That which does not reflect you.
Serving people
Lying to people
Wear costumes in life in front of everyone.
I was wearing a bisht while being filmed on TV.
Are you my mother?
She was wearing adornments, gold and jewelry.
Play
to marry you
What's the situation?
A man walks in front of his wife.
He carries his beard on the sides of his face.
His death does not make them equal or unequal.
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a child?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said.
Come on, help him, man!
Go straight, don't stop.
Has no personality whatsoever.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the look of the city center.
No, no, no, no, it's what keeps him handsome when he sits.
It looks better when you wake up, when you rise, rise, rise.
I'm asking you, Thursday.
What's new, are you going downtown?
Hey, I want to talk to you.
Wherever you go, stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
Do you satisfy yourself with that!
Oh! Thursday
Start it up, and if the presenter is a female
I'm changing the channel because I'm afraid it's going to get me into trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker.
I talk to her.
She tempted him against me with the phone, store it, store it.
She tempted the phone, now it will work on me.
Now you say I let you talk to her because there's a woman with us.
Now I might get kicked out of the house.
Get out!
You're not the first one to get fired.
No, no, no, I can't, brother!
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
I was entrusted with it.
She said, "Don't separate."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you looking for something?
No, no, no, %pw remains, remains.
You are completely crazy.
Do not use it with me at the same time.
Let me know, I want to know what's wrong.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem, especially, is one of the best people in our countries.
He is asking you for a divorce.
Even if he asked me for a divorce, am I crazy to divorce him? This is impossible.
Thursday, I officially went crazy.
Keep me, keep me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
In the name of God, He guides you.
The poor man is sad.
I want to send him an important message from the minister's office.
Whomever you give to, God will guide you.
No, nothing, something
Give me, I will give it.
This is regarding the meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
A woman delegate.
What's wrong with you? Can't you sleep today?
Hello Salim
I am your brother Khamis.
No, I'm really talking to you consciously.
Oh! My brother!
Remove my name, so I'm not involved.
How do we delete your name?
The only one who can remove your name is His Excellency, the Minister.
This is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Inform me of the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Safe and sound, safe, I swear he is safe.
If you're talking to Salem
Do you want to speak?
This lying doesn't work.
Don't lie, Kemas!
Don't tell the truth!
Wearing simple clothes.
She thought I was talking to a woman.
A life very close
May God protect you, please stay safe under the call.
Please, so you can believe her.
I asked you to deliver.
What is your responsibility?
Mind your own business, or you'll become a nuisance.
"And they criticize you."
Hello?! Oh, it's you!
How do you live with a woman who speaks with sharp hearing?
We have started our meeting now.
Hassan went to call Thursday.
Sure, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Start together.
We hope they find it.
He became frightened when he saw the women.
I searched every ministry, and you're hiding here.
Go, go, the people are in the meeting room.
I can't sit with women.
Oh! Thursday, how do you know your wife?
I am afraid she is called.
*Oh my* Do you want her to suspect me, don't you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Do you call your wife at this time!
Of course, because your company is a large one.
This project that your company will implement for our ministry
It is one of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh! People, why is the table shaking?
No, elderly, what is table, it is I.
Can you answer your call?
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He trembled because he was afraid to go home.
His father sent.
Tell him that his wife said: "Don't come home until you change your job and stop working with women."
This is the reason why he sent a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me he approved it, what more does he want!
Isn't his wife with him?
This is crazy.
I ask him who he is talking to.
I told you he's crazy.
What are you doing! Your wife and children are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
Since you did what she wanted, why are you hesitant to go back and see your children?
You want official proof.
Sure, give her the documents.
Sure, that's what I did, I sent a document with her brother.
Look at the signature of the transferor and identify.
And I hope we agree, if we agree, I will return to my house tonight.
Auntie, here is the minister's signature.
What else does he want from you?
Work in the new department will start tomorrow.
It means an office and a job, apart from the job he used to do.
Where is this department, bless you.
Yes, God bless you, here is the minister's permission.
Nothing, nothing, that's it, on your right.
Yes, password, God bless you.
Come in, your office is ready.
Saudi, and Abdul Qadir, provided that God is pleased, a large office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you ask for a change?
The department is all women.
My wife
No one can enforce another decision except the Minister himself.
You need to work until the minister returns.
Hello, brother, agree with your colleagues.
And you need them by their male names, so that your wife doesn't recognize them.
And I added two more for the new worker.
The new employee, he is a male employee.
In a few days, the minister's office became a man who works with us.
Are you serious?!
It looks strange, man, a man working among five women, it looks strange.
They say his wife is very jealous of other women around him.
I am a broad-minded person.
The poor man is in need.
But we were asked to remain silent when his wife was called, and we complied and said nothing.
Yes, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
Make sure the size fits you.
My son called me, he told me that my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Go straight, it's the first floor on your left.
This is in the welfare office.
Commonly as they are ***
These are the sixth group of workers.
And the angels, I am sure he was sent to work.
Lying won't help me.
My wife is jealous of other wives around me.
Because I am manifest.
In the name of Allah, make it easy for you, O Sultan.
But we want to know what stage we have reached.
Brother, Saqr and I were at the bank yesterday.
The one who prepares the project.
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the basement quickly.
I am bearded and ready to go.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women are expected to commit to men.
Sugar spreading causes pain.
This is important for the wind, pay attention, pay attention.
Know yourself, Abay.
Ice, call the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
First, the meeting was postponed until tomorrow.
I hope it's nothing serious.
They regularly issue orders.
And we must apply.
They must realize that you are an important observer.
And you need many responsibilities and commitments.
Women are viewed as agents.
I've never seen people treat women like this before.
How old do they think they are living?
They asked me today not to go to work, but to go to the kitchen and make tea instead.
Where are the workers?
And the other ended a week ago.
Even the workers couldn't bear their violation.
I understand them.
In the name of God, he seeks your mercy.
Criticism is scarce.
Tea
Brother, they mean it.
In fact, a palace complex cannot be without a distinctive building.
Sure, the park...
Brothers, before you leave, I want to talk to you about something.
Oh, my darling Fatoum, I need to go, I'm late.
Sure, tell me, what do you have?
Explain or I'll leave.
I play it at school.
A committee from the Women's Union came today.
I was chosen to represent my school in the tournament.
Are you crazy?
And you want him to enter the tournament.
You know that if you tell your brother and son about this, you won't see any good.
It's you who is being punished.
Not to mention your parents.
Why don't you come and see me, it's been a long time since I last saw you.
A year has passed, a year since I've seen you.
Is he married or still unmarried?
Hello, may God guide you.
Who would consider a husband who doesn't read and doesn't have a diploma?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's uneducated, he's a man.
Khmaies is the son of Skoberion.
His request (his request from my drunkenness) is a request.
One should have a marriage with someone of the same social standing.
As if it were a carbon copy.
In the name of God, he seeks your mercy.
What I can do, Aisha!
Since the minister has traveled, all documents are sent to me.
Mustafa, the head of the recruitment department, was informed that I want to meet with him tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
You own the table.
And now I am allowed to speak with you, Aisha!
Yes, Mary.
Sure, with me, sure, I have it with me now.
Oh my, Aisha!
My sons are the cause of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
No problem, my dear, the fillers are needed so the face doesn't look too big.
Why didn't we warn her not to go and talk to them about it?
I went to them, but they weakened it.
You know that I delayed them because it was a journey?
They have been beating you for a long time.
How harmful, to play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
I know what he's talking to you about.
High blood sugar
The small one.
Yes, but brother, I didn't hit her, only Sultan did that.
Did you hear that?
I chose economics and political science.
I chose graphics because they are in demand now.
Architecture!
It doesn't belong to you currently.
It was an opportunity for you.
You don't want much.
Sure, just sugar.
Cherish her, and be captivated by her lips.
I want to hit her.
She is with me here.
Go to the grants department.
And delete building engineering.
Choose to persist.
To make sure of that
I searched with Sultan and Saqr.
They don't care if Monira marries you.
Does he want something else from you?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves the very best.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and keep you informed.
Your election to join the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
I'm telling you the truth.
They care about you a lot.
And your selection by the minister.
This is true.
I know my brothers to be simple.
They never agree.
I am surprised.
Their car loans are paid from my salary.
And I provide for the house.
She wants me to travel with her.
Are we presenting her marriage this week?
What are you saying?
Crazy Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
She married and moved with him.
Complete, let's go
This is insulting.
If you refuse, you will torment her.
Oh! My son, I've told you many times.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow I will go.
Don't worry, as long as he is a son of Scorion.
Form doesn't matter.
I don't want to marry Thursday.
And I go to the floor.
And I put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona match today
I hope Vanesia loses for us.
My source is reliable.
It is spacious and intentionally designed.
What do you think about that?
What do you want me to do?
We need to go.
Please go to your dwellings.
Thank you, may God grant you a long life.
Long life
Coffee is served there.
Its emptiness
In the name of God, God listens to her throughout life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, sir.
Yes, I wish God grants you a long life.
Did you wash the coffee cup?
Go and offer coffee to Commander Imad.
And also
We will enter the Chinese market the day after tomorrow.
Of course, sir, I forgot to introduce my sister Mary to you.
I'm going to the official launch.
Are you crazy?
You don't know anything in life, and you need to marry a minister.
Write "Hello" to %pw
Yes, ma'am.
Move it and build a new one.
Actors are requested.
You know, and my paralysis has confined me to bed in a terrible manner.
What can I say to her?
This is sad, Nawaf's role doesn't suit him.
Noof is a 16-year-old girl.
And the torch stands out in the twenties.
Sure, why don't you take Mary's role?
Suits her better.
Nouf will be enough for thirty.
We must get rid of the person accused in the committee.
It's a problem, I'm sure he won't let it go smoothly.
It's tailored.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose that committee?
The minister is the one who established the committee.
I, you, and Hamad can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
Nothing indicates that it belongs to us.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company is issued in the name of Hammad's wife, I hope God blesses you.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry, indeed, who is the head of the committee?
The final word is with me.
No, no, everything is fine, come in.
I answered them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically dedicated to determining whether we will approve successive "conscious coercion" or not.
It is produced by the Institute of Contemporary Arts.
Consistent, distinctive, and brave.
I agree with Hamad.
The storyline of the series is excellent.
I agree with you.
I loved when she took the weapon and killed her colleague.
She wanted to hide the weapon, so she put it in the car.
And she did not know that he was her son, that's exciting, and when the police turned away.
Her son finishes school.
And I submit a square.
So he let it go and ran to his mother's window.
There's a surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
It's good that a local company produces this advanced level of output.
We should encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You're leaving me speechless.
With all due respect to your opinion and analysis of the series, this is "moral coercion."
And man's deeds are exposed.
Worn-out surprise
One and a half people per ring.
The other half is left for the next episode.
This secrecy is written without social awareness.
Does not carry a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears are falling, why do you have to make the viewers cry?
I excuse you, Rashid.
We've given you our opinion, we've given you his opinion, let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
It is clear from the meeting.
That there is an agreement between you both.
You organized it.
Some people are understood by those who manage them, while others are not connected to the field.
I oppose him being serial.
I'm afraid it will cause us problems.
Ignore him.
What he can do, he can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Ms. Samira.
I don't know what to do.
I don't believe him, Nasser!
This is for a new series we'll be launching soon.
The daughter is retrieved by the retriever.
When I got the benefits I got because of her.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
So they're showing it under Hammad's wife's name, who sent you the episode.
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
Owns 5% of the production
Good job
I've played a similar role, haven't you seen "Lost Dreams"?
Since you say
It's called fraud, I don't remember.
Yes, dream fraud
Why are all the names similar?
The series last year were about girls.
You notice that each chain contains more than eight girls, or even ten.
Your master is sure.
You are very beloved.
Undoubtedly, you're lucky.
Yes, Omar.
Sure, sure
I'll excuse you, dear, I must go to work, I don't know what happened there.
Eat and run.
He said he wanted to see me about an important and urgent matter.
I need to go.
I heard that Rashid met with the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
And tell him that you will work on annoying him.
I told you that he complained about us to the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called me and asked to meet with me.
I also fear that the minister will think it's true.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to explain his viewpoint on confidentiality.
This is all.
This is true, I wish you a long life.
But first, sir, I would like to say that it is unacceptable to talk about your colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He is a hindrance to everyone around him.
He cares only about the financial benefit.
But that's his specialty.
But, I wish God would bless you, no ordinary teacher can handle these technical matters.
Producing distinctive television programs
Moral coercion, the series we're making
This is a very large production.
We will take an informational initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong spread
Of course, this is your profession, you know better than me about this matter.
I entrust you with a large chain.
He will defend our name.
Look at what journalist Abdelhamid wrote, listen listen.
As one actor said
What is published promotes an unacceptable idea.
This is limited by the fall of the congratulators.
This is a genuine, powerful, and highly challenging assessment.
They will be in big trouble if journalist Abdelhamid continues writing about them.
And when the people to whom it was made forbidden learn it.
But they are finite, and they know how to manage.
They are from a large category.
We need to create our own website.
And put all our company's activities on it.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The moral chain reaction initiated by Mercury Productions is considered to be
A qualitative launch in Arab theater
Because he carries ideas and moral values.
This is a series aimed at developing the community.
It's the same presenter who criticized them just a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept that?
The editor Abdelhamid and others like him
Don't worry, Mr. Hammad.
He asked me what I thought of the series, I told him it would become the best series in the Arab world.
I hope so.
I feel that our series will be stunning.
I don't know where he is.
One is refueled and ready to go.
The beginning must be enjoyable.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the facts didn't actually happen.
It's evident at first glance.
Your composition is simplistic.
It may happen.
Your number is scary, scary.
What do you think?
This is very sad.
Other bad series are not a justification.
This production can be understood from the beginning.
These are hidden lines and scales, requiring a focused person to explore them.
Since You, a political series.
It is essential to look at it.
What's the problem?
You weren't nervous about the haiku yesterday.
I was at the Souq and Geef yesterday with Ali.
We were in a coffee shop.
I neglected myself.
Eagle, what do you think about what happened? The minister is disturbed; this is a big problem.
In a week, we'll all be executed.
It's a failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him that the cereal failed and has no effect.
This is a disaster.
I'll finish it for you.
We publish what a traveler does.
Listen to him.
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
To him be hope.
A few days ago, I saw an article criticizing his production and also insulting him.
Don't make me nervous.
I'm sorry.
On that day, I was going out.
I never allow them to write that.
But frankly, I haven't received any encouraging messages.
Once again, a great success.
Goodbye
Brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Moral coercion is the best television production.
They live longer, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I'm hard-hearted.
After a while, they told me.
Without a doubt, the minister is pleased.
Frankly, Nasser
Stay ready to watch "Moral Compulsion 2"
No, no, no, no, enough, brother!
The chain, he said he wouldn't write again.
He prefers to stay in his dead-end job.
A second part after all these complications.
One, three, one, fourth.
What's wrong with you? What do you want to gain?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What the optimist can do
I wish you greater success.
Please let us know your opinion on that success.
I thank God for this success.
They are the ones who hate and compete with our success.
I find it strange.
The one who wins awards while being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They are awarded prizes for it, so they must see what we don't.
Reconstruct two parts of the series.
Surely, a long life has been granted to you.
Real juice
You will see, "rational coercion" will
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do TV festivals lie?
I heard him say: "Prepare for part two."
This is the same thing.
They are taken to the shore to be washed and become clean.
All the weak, strange, and immoral series you see.
Chosen at Arab and Gulf festivals
Because we clean them and give them awards, they are seen as high-value.
Sure, that's right.
Since the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, thanks be to God that you have arrived.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
I reach my office.
We are not a little cookie house or bake shops.
We are one of the leading bread companies in the world.
We won't reduce it.
No, we'll terminate the contract.
We signed a contract yesterday.
With the British company.
A cup and a papa.
As you wish.
He completed his job excellently.
He will be the first in the world to produce that product.
He's still the best baker of bread in the world.
I'll tell you.
How is bread with (soustas)?
It can be opened with your hand or you go to the kitchen and look for a spoon to cut it with, and you might cut your hand.
So, make bread with sourdough.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a jacket.
So what do you think, it's actually a bread bag.
How do we remove this zipper?
If that's the case, he can tell his friend: "I ate two buttons."
Why wasn't the cooked dish delivered to Light Mountains Hospital yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you send it yesterday?
The blanket you make
Once again, informants used it.
What happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time tomorrow and delaying my work.
You know your son loves the country.
So what's the problem if a few employees from the company go for entertainment?
The company consists of four people.
Ten key players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why are you angry with him?
But they are temporarily accepted. Although the fans are the most important players on the field and the 12th player.
I'll give you their contact details for the hobby.
We have already signed a contract with the people.
When I first told you he wanted to play football
Listen to you.
He didn't do anything.
No, you're only nervous with him because he took some workers to play football in front of him and enjoyed it.
I didn't say he couldn't hire some employees.
Even if some of your friends need some workers, you can help them with a few.
The important market stall
Sure, son, why take important manufacturers, that can't be done.
Next time, tell me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamdi finish these documents.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they inform you?
I finished the work, and as I was getting into the car
You exhausted me.
I traveled to him.
He said they didn't find the defensive player as they played an important game today.
He said: "Look for my defender," and then we arrived at the stadium.
Wear goal-oriented clothing.
I didn't play football yesterday.
This case
Disobedient
And you will find us working a job instead of spending your time on football.
I'm explaining to you.
Father, do you want me to cancel and disband the team?
Yes, correct.
Of course, Father. Please, I beg you.
I can't fire the team, tomorrow is the final match.
No, no, no, he is truthful.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on the win.
Congratulations, Mr. Nasser, on your cup victory.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, I prepare the team physically, mentally, and psychologically, and the coach worked hard.
At the hotel
Your wishes to everyone, and I'll be a party, as promised.
It seems your father is happy.
I'm afraid he's just being friendly and respectful.
Father Nasser, firstly, we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For such a great success
God bless you, no, no, no.
No picture without a bisht (traditional men's cloak), wait, wait, stop it.
No, no
He is wearing a bisht.
Attention, concern, and the creative opinions you held played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
And the coach's plan
But, they played 5-5-3-2 in the finals.
And as a player, you know that changing the game plan disrupts players, but the Bread team didn't falter and performed excellently.
And the coach's plan
Bunsen, as the first players on the International Bread Team, what do you recommend players do?
To infinity
Hello
Long life
They are welcome. Is Humood Sultan with them?
Those who deserve are welcome, but they deserve to be with us for dinner first.
Dinner, excellent!
Thank you, Bou Abdellaziz.
And it is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't sense me.
No, who?
Bou Abdellaziz
The representative for the engines we use in the factory.
You see.
I've wanted to know him for a long time.
Soccer introduced me to him, I reminded him of that.
I said to him, "O Abu Abdullah"
You've never cared about football your whole life.
What does this have to do with you?
The ball was always close to me, there was a distance of 50 cm between us.
Has Nasser arrived yet?
No, he didn't show up today either.
Organizer of a conference on football injuries, the yellow investor, must be present.
You will see more.
Did you see the building behind the restaurants that he wanted to convert into a workers' headquarters?
He is obsessed with football.
As is customary, we tend to meet and interview a figure in the sports field.
This man inspires the kitchen team with his great idea.
What do you think about the International Restaurants Team? We've heard that you're undergoing comprehensive development.
Compared to workplace amenities, all efforts
This is a small amount of money, just a million dollars for all this effort.
No man, be a modifier.
What's wrong with me, Shahin?
You missed me.
So what's my mistake?
You told me you need players for the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices are at a high rate.
Which means a player costs two thousand.
The project will cost three or four million dollars.
I don't understand him, explain it to me.
Receive a fax from here
And read it to me when you have it with you.
I bought my father four new players for the team, in addition to a new shipment of four players.
You know, he's amazing, he can beat both Billy and Ronaldo.
But 800,000 is written on itself.
Yes, that's correct, may God bless you, but a Turkish club set this price.
In the United Arab Emirates, it is sold for one million and twenty thousand.
Don't look at me.
Sure, can we evaluate the product?
This exists.
The rear man
This is good, okay.
No, no, no, I definitely assure you.
He is old, by the grace of God, it is better to be old.
This one is suitable, it fits the middle.
Attached muscle
This is the most important member, a player cannot play without it.
Thank you.
Send my regards to the Automatic Club, Automatic, what did I say! Automatic
How does it happen?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
This is a young team, God bless you.
Yes, we source them from African forests.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
"Mercy, you are the one who deserves what you deserve. Do you have a place for the site or should I bring it by truck?"
When he saw that they were pressuring us.
The offending player asked to play.
"Kaka nu malali dindaah, nu" translates to "Father doesn't know, yet."
Ask the defender to move.
Kagumakani Lolo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars
Spain! Even if it's raining in March.
I don't like the way he runs the game.
This should be on North Street.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's happening? Why are you screaming?
Your mischievous son
He doesn't trust that the coach is interested in football.
Listen to her, she talks like a savage.
He knows that the mistake-prone player Silo Tekawaua is a good midfielder, as Ahmed Allateb said.
No one gives you sharpness.
Stay, but don't come close.
I know how to handle him.
Why did the team fail to pull away?
The team must think about changing the plan.
Since the players aren't playing in their positions.
And if the selected text is imported, it is moved to its middle position.
Ask the coach to change the ...
Cancel Hopway Malalo
Sure, sure, sure.
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
This is what should not happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please defer these matters until the playground is finished.
People are watching this, it's happening right in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Team Success, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he is the star of the match today.
This coach is wrong in his thinking.
Tell him, Brother Bunaser did not want you as a coach for his team for sure.
And you, close it.
I'm watching the game on TV and you're just pacing around, do anything I ask you to do.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how can we play without a coach?
What's my father doing?
Enough, Rashid!
What's wrong with you? You're pissing me off, tell me what's wrong with you?
You were fired, Mom, you were fired.
Scattered? How?
I don't know my mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know, I don't know.
You are married for a noble cause!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, Mother, I don't know. He suddenly came and asked me to go to your family's house.
I asked him why? He said: "It's over."
I swear, I don't know what's going on?
They were married for only a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I only know that he got it out of you, now.
Step aside. I'll be there in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
Insulted Barclay.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me in tears.
He said she criticized Barcelona, which he considers a team he loves and respects.
She insulted him and hurt his feelings.
Her mother told me she insulted Barcelona, and I told him to divorce her and I will find you another wife.
Tell him that your daughter is dumped because she criticized Barcelona team.
Since the only reason for divorcing her is that you're serious?
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife is killed by her husband's loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international teams.
This time, you started laughing at Messi.
Problems are arising between the couple and we need to act.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
The girl is grown up and you need to get her married.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And please don't interfere, this is my son and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
I'll be angry with you.
Don't worry, my son, and don't think about it.
For one boy, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you laughing?!
But when I remember her words
That Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
No, my dear.
What's the problem with ha!
Her name is Mona.
Was her marriage for a month?
If I told you her story and the reason for her divorce, you wouldn't stop laughing.
For your information, we want your attention.
What's the use of a person like this, he takes his wife to a football team.
The cold knows them, and I'll leave the rest of the story to your imagination. Mother, don't include me in this, I don't associate with such people.
That's all, you hear fallacies from poets' engineers.
Tell them I do not approve.
So, say what you want to say and speak your mind.
Wealth comes to her.
I told her, "Girl, you're not going to stop your destiny."
If it's just her luck, I don't care at all.
But it will end her fate and ours with her.
This building
Don't refuse me.
God is sufficient against this evil misleader.
They hear a piece of news and spin it.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and make her understand not to close the door of opportunity that will open for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You're laughing? Do you think he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all these formalities and don't be so uptight.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And it may be that she is the reason or something wrong with her made him leave her.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Borgian escape from your hands.
What is this Abu Burgeyan?
But when they approach, they find that it is two buildings.
That's why they call his father Shahin Abu Bourjyan.
In the name of God, He seeks your ease.
Oh, no, no, no. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
May God settle you, they took the money, you were presented, and they spent it on him.
Sir, you were idle and moreover expanding, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, divorced.
He was married and divorced.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And this is his secret, O brother, I pray for him.
Oh! Human, this is a difficult generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations, my daughter!
The girl doesn't forget her fork; I placed it on the napkin.
Get it with you during check-in for the flight.
When you reach London
Sure, boy, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mom
No problem.
To get to go with us and buy things too.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Malaysia takes the animal with you.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
I'm asking her, and I don't know what's happening.
Tell me, girl, what's going on?
You did the best you could by ignoring her.
They are something and nothing.
During her early marriage, she is supposed to be prepared in every way.
Is it logical for her to sit while the water is being poured?
And the glass is beside you, don't carry it and don't allow yourself to drink from it.
I was not raised in a good environment.
You should have told her that since I was born, I have been drinking water from my mother's hand.
What's wrong with her?
You look very sad.
And who is this lady with?
Her name is Michelle.
Without reason, she called off the marriage in the tenth of love.
Do you believe what I tell you about his story?
God bless you, Auntie, thank you.
Your sister and her sister were requested.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked us?
Hello, Mom.
Where did you book the copies?
Because she wants her to go there with us.
He owns nothing except for the sake of God.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the children?
What happened between them?
Who asked you? I don't know what happened between them!
Frankly, it's distorted talk.
So, where is Munira?
She is in her room talking to this simplifier.
Now you say she was praying for him for two hours with her eyes closed.
Meet him now.
We wait to make sure what he has.
How do you know he's disturbed? The boy comes from outside tired and wants to rest.
Mom, every day I tell her to stop eating the apples, but she doesn't. Every day she hurts me.
And you know that I don't like apples with their skin.
Don't garnish me with lemon.
Hello, let me tell you
You are dispersed.
And an extra one when needed.
Go, my dear!
Go, my dear!
Monir, what did he say?
Why are you getting upset too?!
Call him three times and tell him you're broken.
Lock it, God bless you.
I don't know if my mother saw me in the roundabout in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
True, he has nothing to say.
She lied twice or three times.
And that he who separates my daughter dies.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where should I go? I'll pour my anger out on this criminal man.
They are like birds leaning on each other.
Named gold, rumba, offspring, and daman.
And the other sisters are your dolls and your son.
They have no beds or mothers, and they have a bad taste in their mouths.
Those you laugh at
And you can humiliate them as you please.
You didn't help her drink water, you insulted Barkley, you fired her and forgot about her.
The night was double.
Without shame or embarrassment
The deputy, an Arab and a loyalist.
He cares about his son's and sons' reputation.
He remained motionless.
Do you have humanity?
It was from my father.
Who's going to empty this place?
Abu Sakr forced it from his parents.
Why are you selling it?
In the name of God, may He guide you. Verily, Abu Sakar needs something. Who will tell him no?
Simply leave it to your Lord, O man.
Enter, enter.
Let's go, let's go.
What happened with Abu Sa'd's project?
As you know.
No, last week you said you'd get back to his file?
I told you that if you wanted to run your project, you had to start by funding it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
What does he eat? Does anyone in this world eat?
This is not the problem, my brother. We can make him eat, feel full, and fill his stomach, but the problem is how to reach him.
And they will know the angel of my father Abisaghir, then all doors will be opened to you.
I meet him in Umrah and love him more than once.
You don't need to know it as long as you can recall it and make use of it. You don't need to know the right moment.
When the accelerator told me that Abu Sakar was embracing you at dinner.
I arrived immediately.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, has a dinner party every day.
Oh! Someone, anyone.
He enjoys gatherings and meeting with friends.
It's excellent to stay at this farm at night.
Yes, sir, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car rental company next to the mall.
He wants to get to know you as a brother.
Obtain the permits.
It's as if my son obtained the license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on the permits, Saker.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you for what will not weaken me, say yes.
Just say yes, your master.
As a gift to him.
And please, don't say no.
My work is going well.
This means you met him easily and talked to him.
Don't be crazy.
Yes, okay, Abu Nasr.
Tell me what technology is, what has it done?
Circumstances were on my side.
When we were sitting with him.
His son got the permit.
I have a gift for you.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
First, first, I penetrated him.
Yes, it happened.
I was discharged from the hospital.
He underwent a laryngectomy.
And there will certainly be a dinner.
You deserve your son's health, Simon!
We hope it improves, we hope it improves if God wills, he will not see any harm if God wills.
We met at the earring store.
I think so.
Oh! Human, we started to forget and grow old.
And they told me that your son Shahin was in the next room and that he has already left.
So, I thought I needed to visit you.
And I congratulate you on the safety of Shahin.
"Please, my lord, don't go without having dinner with us."
I can't think about it.
Say yes first.
Because our beloved son Shahin has left the hospital,
In my tower on the shore.
Say yes.
Oh! Son, don't break.
No matter how much you try, I don't like swapping and I have no intentions for it.
Who can start a project today without capital?
In the vehicle and tractor department, he said, "Just give me the keys."
Love is from God, and people adore you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love your father and respect him.
Many of them are in his session every night.
What God wills, everyone loves him, your father, you just point.
Oh! People take loans from banks to establish a company or a project.
Am I sitting in a supermarket?
Have you opened a juice store?
This is also something new.
This is a reader, the light of my eyes, he brought them to me yesterday and said: These are samples, try them.
He just got it yesterday.
You see.
He also clarified to me that all businessmen are like me; Lord, make all people like you.
Yes, sir.
When I was walking to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing him.
Frankly, I love him.
I don't know who owns it.
Congratulations, congratulations, brother, congratulations.
God bless you.
In the name of God, in the name of God
Who can join as a partner and take it easily (term)
You, you are allowed to say no now.
So, what's the problem?
What am I saying?
Be her partner.
Don't you know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
I said I was Qasem Abbas's friend, he asked me if I had experience in business.
I said: I have a bakery, thank God, I live off of it.
No, no, I don't like his name.
I didn't notice it.
No, brother! The name is not good.
So a suitable name for an Iranian duck.
Sure, the big bread.
Kasem, we'll call it the Great Bread House.
Wait for me a little.
Peace be upon you.
Peace and mercy be upon you, O peace.
Excellent, excellent. So, do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank you, God loves everything good.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
You sent your car for repairs and ended up taking mine, because you're a brand ambassador for a marketing company and you can't do anything without your car.
You may also need your car.
No, I don't need the car today.
Sure, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid that everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, regardless of what that field is.
Excellent, sir! Dr. Sami
Yes, sir.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study business or economics.
He has never read a book in his entire life, not even a newspaper. I have never seen him hold a piece of paper in his hands.
You all know who Sager is today.
I don't want to enter this field and work, but
My father Nasser, his brother, is still alive before you.
The one he loves.
But there are people born for trade, by nature they love trade.
You're honest, Doctor!
Since you, Shahin, are becoming like your brother.
God is the Giver (the Restorer), full of hope.
He is still in the early stages.
This thing depends on the soil.
No one can be like you, Doctor!
Frankly.
How did Sager, who hates trade, reach this great economic feeling?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they will count them among them.
Do you know, Abu Sakar?
Sagar was chosen for the market position.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser?
Muhammad called me and told me that Abu Nisar was in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Saqr bin Abi Saqr wants to take over the car agency from my father?
But who owns the place now?
People just don't stop.
The father helped him enter the market.
He embarked on a business venture.
Frankly, the doctor said he was in critical condition.
This is what is not done.
Nothing fails.
Surprised or shaken, that doesn't concern me, I'm telling you that you'll separate them, you will separate them, and you will separate them.
There were people like this in the twentieth century.
We meet with our dear viewers with one of the good and compassionate men in this country.
A man teaches the way for the needy and those suffering from poverty.
So, we have the founder and owners in the Sakr Charity Organization.
Of course, if we're talking about this institution, Sir.
We all know your great goals that you seek to offer to the world and, of course, to all people.
Without deception or desire for fame, God forbids.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds; recently, a pricing strategy was completed for our sisters in Africa.
And now, thank God, we are ready for release.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
God willing, O people of respect, may God make many like you.
My wife and I moved out of the house.
But my wife will be away for a quarter of an hour to open her new project.
And I will wait for her.
No problem.
Frankly, I love their atmosphere and I enjoy sitting with them. I really have a good time.
And it is a source of income for my sons.
This is all my life.
I think you want me to waste my time.
Conquer problems.
No, hot bread, hot bread.
So let's go, folks!
There were people like this in the twentieth century.
There were people like this in the twentieth century.
If anyone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
He needs bold men.
The prosperity of the market and the endowments.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you all.
Everyone loves you, Shahin, love is from goodness.
I want to say something, but tell me yes.
On the subject of permits, my son Shahin is supposed to go to the exhibition and switch to the best and most expensive car as a gift from him to me.
The air rushed upon us from the opening in the middle.
Oh winds, for love, take me home.
Hello Fadi
How are you, Unnod?
No, no, no, no, no.
She told me the suit would be ready in a week, and gave me a note yesterday saying it would be ready in ten days, man! It's confusing.
And you want it with jewels, and that needs more time.
What if God wants you to start talking to Alanoud and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, make the whole world tense, but Ond won't be tense.
What Fadi needed was to start feeling envious.
Oh God, I love the way they speak, I feel sorry for her, compared to our people.
Don't let me forget the subject.
Am I dressed?
There is Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
Brother Fadi, I'll come by next week to pick up the uniform, okay, bye.
How can I help you?
Send the dress to my house.
No, I don't like it.
Masha'Allah, today I went to Fadi's place, he's doing some unique work, and the girls are coming and going.
Thank God, we succeeded greatly in this project.
What's that only?
Abu Nasser, my brothers.
What do you have?
Look at the praise!
And we never heard him initiate a project, from where this dependent would get the money.
Her mouth agape, theft!
And when he starts his work,
Are you sure?
I heard some rumors.
And if God wills, you won't do anything?
It's 7 a.m.
Do you want them to serve you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already eaten breakfast.
But, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you
You want to start a business.
I know nothing about such a thing, may God guide you, brother.
Design, women's fashion design, etc.?
Who lied to you?
I am an investor!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You need advice, you need %pw, I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you my brothers, thank you.
So give me, I need to go.
Enter, my lord!
Let me know if you need me to increase it.
So, Fadi, clean the warehouse. Are you busy as I see?
The grocery store isn't enough for him.
She said you'll get the shop next door, rely on God and get it.
I hope so.
Did they buy the place next to it?
Is there anyone named Khalid Sultan Al-Seif other than your brother Abu Nasser?
No, what's there?
I am from the Ministry of Economy, I saw his name in a deal with my friend, Osama, and he is working on managing it.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the ring and read his name on it.
What's wrong with him, what's wrong with him, what's wrong with him.
What's wrong with it, what's wrong with it, what's wrong with it, it has a flaw.
Your sick hearts never left you.
When I saw that my project was successful.
She told me I needed to destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasr.
Is he happy? What does he say?
And when I asked you, you told me, were you intending to start a project?
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your demands.
But this doesn't lead you.
People, this is a job, and everyone takes their job.
You are hitting me.
Sure, you're a family.
No, no, no, Abu Salim abolished the borders.
You're hitting me in my own house!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring a designer from Lebanon.
I am a woman and I will be asked.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Oh! Madam, this suits you wonderfully, no, no, no, this, this, there's nothing like it in all of Doha.
Oh, this suits you, madam, and from these beautiful words and the piece worth a thousand, it's sold for thirty or forty thousand.
Yes, do as he does.
As you know, the cabinet I made last year with the Lebanese engineer.
Welcome, madam. I will design for you two distinctive cabinets in each room.
Look, if you want to succeed
What exactly do you have in mind?
Why don't you know?
This means he stole the clients.
What do you think about moving to another place? Oh! The manager.
Don't mention it, don't mention it, Fadi.
By this time they will be playing by themselves.
Which means we lost, no!
We need to confront them!
And return our clients, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'll pay.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
This suit I chose costs six thousand riyals.
Of course without the bars in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
And I'm putting it down to you, there are only fifty pieces of this crystal in all the countries of the world, and this crystal piece is very distinctive.
Of course there is no discount, our prices are globally renowned.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Lady, wait, wait, what's the problem? What happened?
Call the prayer for us, O Sa'd, call the prayer for us.
Is this something they do?
They acknowledged us, but we had no dealings with them.
This is called war, Abu Nasser.
We won't stand and watch!
We need to fight them the way they fight us, and respond to them as well.
I will get a loan from the bank tomorrow.
And I'll start a war with them, and you'll see what I'll do.
Abu Nasser can't be stopped.
Check the ad!
He made a show of putting up the advertisement!
We offer free evening wear delivery with every wedding dress.
I use it with four color printers, each with a wedding color.
We publish an ad in a quarter page.
Look, he's running a half-page ad.
I don't know what he meant!
Do you believe me or Nasser?
For seven days, he did not respond to their request.
No, and this evening they didn't open, they assassinated.
And you will hear that he sold out his own kind.
I'll kill him, I'll kill him.
Even they don't control it there, control it outside.
Forget it, drink your tea and go to him.
"What tea does God guide you to? I don't drink it, that's a problem."
Is anyone carrying you against your will?
There is a divine messenger using this scent intentionally in the store.
They are chemicals.
Are you sure someone farted in the store?
You are brothers, you are adults, don't fight like children.
He came at night and sprayed a bad smell in the place, is that fair?
I didn't smell anything, it's your scent.
Do not cross the line.
You signed promises at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I prepared a killer plane for him.
Without conceding that anyone seen is in error.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear I don't know what's going on, this is the fourth day we've had only one customer.
"Oh no, this is cattle, we'll take the other place, I opened my face, may God guide you."
And what did the doctor say to you?
The grocery store is empty, and no customers are entering.
I don't know if magic has been performed for them.
Women and girls, do not approach the area.
As if Saad had been transformed into a frightening creature by magic.
Possible, anything is possible today.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Is he asleep or awake?
Go and take a look, brother. Go, I'm afraid the roof might collapse.
I lost, Sultan, I lost.
I don't know, he's been through a lot!
He took him as a worker!
Calm down, brother, don't worry.
I don't know what he did.
I tell you, dear, what have you done to him, it is said that his friends have started to collect money and pay off his debts.
Designed by its engineer.
Not Lebanese
Do you tell him, do you tell him?
Don't you know where he is?
The stars are hers, and we hastily search for those additions.
Call the man again, he might have an emergency.
I've had enough of you, I've had enough of you, brother of Ahmed!
What's wrong with you, Hammad? You're sitting here while the group leader is shouting at me! What should I do? Where are the other missing people you said you would send today?
I'd rather be left alone, I asked him and got a sour response, so I even asked Mr. Abdullah.
First thing: Don't shout, we're actors and we want to rest a bit, we need to focus on our roles. Second thing, the man has called in front of me more than once, just calm down.
What are you saying, Mr. Abdullah? What are you saying?
Oh! Mr. Abdullah, what should I do now? The director will finish the scene and take revenge on me.
No, friends, no, friends.
We want to continue, but these additional people who were supposed to play here aren't with me anymore.
Don't want anyone to call you out, is that okay?
I work in silence and without threats.
This is our situation always screaming from morning till now. We need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about managing yourself in context even if God wanted me to provide you with a representative who could play the role well?
It's true that he'll only work on one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But please, sir, go and shoot now, please.
But if you're not ready today, I'll leave.
People, let's go upstairs.
I'll tell you something, there's a Filipino, is that okay?
If Led's parents find out, he will withdraw immediately. He needs someone who resembles the wealthy, he must be rich and Qatari.
Oh! A man, he'll move with a passport and a hurry, no one will notice.
Are you serious, Alaa? You want it easy? This is production that respects people's feelings and intelligence.
She gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you will be held accountable.
Calm down, let's think. Reem, think with me, you might remember someone from your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmedi, do you remember someone in the Salla area named Saud Bokthorn?
Saud soaked himself in the blackthorn.
%PW Saad, be quiet!
The manager said he needs a man of means, and you say cans.
Hello, by the end of the day, he is an extra person, you will work on hiring a distinguished and respectable man for an extra position.
But with a little makeup, Rim and Zeh are dressed in clean clothes and a luxurious car.
Since it's appropriate.
How do we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy?
So who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, here it is, here it is.
Yes, here it is, thank you very much.
And now how will it work, O Mother? There is no guttoro except this trio that my brothers brought from abroad.
Do you only have what you're wearing?
The son, here he is inside the closet under my clothes.
People are waiting outside the door, what should I heat up?
In the name of God, may God have mercy on you, my son.
This means that today I will be watching you and you'll be on TV.
Yes, Mother, they told me I'd be on TV as one of the rich.
Arm yourself, dammit!
I connect, man. What is it? A curse on you.
Used, used.
Here I am, Mom.
Quick, Mother, do you feel at ease?
If God wills, my son!
He can't bear it, I hope they give you some money.
In the name of God, he seeks your mercy.
Ask for me.
I'm offering you a black pen, a black laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the blessings and mercy of God.
Is this Abuud, the son of Fatima, Abuud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saad?
Is the situation doable?
Sure, sure, we hope he'll execute it well, calm down and be quiet, so he can give me a complex role.
I say to myself, "How is your mother?"
He is not the same person who used to collect postage stamps before.
You are denied, you are denied, be silent.
You are now wearing a lens.
You are a grown man now.
No change, I'll regret nominating you.
The man who came as Abu Baldaliz.
This is here, they brought it, hello, hello, hello.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Gavil Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I'm just afraid of God.
Don't worry, be quiet, listen to his instructions, and say yes to something the manager told you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome, my brother, play the role of one of the rich, one of the distinguished people, do you understand or not?
Auto, boy, auto, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is too excessive, the role needs a stable person.
Everything is acceptable from certain people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
Brother, we bought this for filming. Listen, I'll take you to the dressing room now and I'll rehearse you for the role.
You are denied, you are denied, you are denied.
Please let them get there.
Take me to her.
Improvise, improvise, improvise here, here!
Thank God you're here, come in, come in.
Sir, the car you need for the trip is ready.
Saoud will clean everything, he will weave it.
Let's repeat it again, the assistant is here to see you and assure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a famous merchant.
Are you saying this?
Sure, sure, I'll tell you, be careful, be careful, don't rush, I didn't expect that from you, Abu Abdulaziz, say you are Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights.
Distinctive, and you know!
Revive my death, O brother!
Full name: Abu Abdul Aziz Falah Al-Murzouk, Jamil.
Excellent, do it, do it and see.
Promise your daughter a divorce.
Don't trouble yourself about the reason for her divorce.
Your daughter is scattered, is she pretty? Is she pretty?
She's a predator, be careful and consider yourself, we don't get married.
Why don't I praise Him?
Excellent, you are excellent and remember everything, excellent.
Make him clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Oh! Man, the landlords gave us a surprise, they need the hall, and the director decided to complete the scenes in the hall, and then we'll shoot the exterior scenes.
How is he? He doesn't want them!
Yes, they want, they want, but it was postponed later, they will move to another scene and we will follow them if God wills.
Should I tell them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you.
A blessed height.
Hello, what tribe are you from, boy!
My name is Salem Abu Shweih Shweih.
The Shi'ites are famous.
You deserve it.
I feel, my breath is heavy and every pair of lips that meets here.
Inform me, O brother of people with a crooked nose,
I am conscious of myself.
If it weren't for him, she wouldn't stop laughing.
Keep this for a minute.
Hello, Mom.
My mother is very sick, I must go quickly, brother!
They will complete them.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, very sick, he said!
Listen to me, you can do that, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we can't leave the site.
No, no, I'll try to find a taxi. Ah, brother.
What's a taxi? If you tried to look for a taxi for a year, you wouldn't find one.
You know we're handing the car over to the authorities.
Since it's composite, choose it.
Sure! Brother, give me the key. Mom is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
He is in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
One moment, and one moment, I'll bring a stretcher now, now! Sir!
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
The girl is very sick in the car and I will need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
Oh! Your son, what happened?
Be silent and do not speak, just observe when you are silent.
Peace be upon you.
Nothing, but my mother, a lady, has a breathing disorder, quickly.
I'll tell them to make the bed.
No, no.
And do not suffer.
God is sufficient for you. What have you done?
Excellent, Rashood.
I care about our son, Rashid.
As you wish, follow me, Mr. Rashood.
Stay with me, Mr. Rashood.
And I will take Mr. Rashood and do what is necessary for him.
This is what is expected of you.
I will tell the working lady to come and examine what drink she wants.
Take me away, Master Rashood.
I excuse you.
What I do, many do, wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, would you like to drink tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first, Nasser, hospital security, Filipino wife.
Who told you I was rejected?
No woman cares for me.
They think and demand.
He doesn't have a certificate, I don't want your mother, what, I don't want your mother! Go find your friends.
Hello, brother. There's a girl in the hospital, I love her.
If she ignores you, find someone else.
I can't, brother, my heart is attached.
I want you to be loving, I think, when I see her.
Bring this to Dr. Mohannad.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
May God ease things for you.
Sir, our condition is now excellent.
You are a professional actor, Saad. Friends, next!
Go, do you see how they laughed at you and how much they praised you?
Now, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh! Anyone who forgets this, come and breathe on me first here.
Yes, from now on, my name is Valle Almárzuz.
Fulfill this and write "black."
Saad was injured.
From now on, my name is Valle Merazo, Abu Abdelaziz.
God bless you, my dear.
One restaurant!
I did two.
Frankly, I heard one of the wedding relatives say: "I wish they were very well-mannered. I don't think anyone could do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
No, dear, moody.
Act like this, Mother.
I need to present something to them at the moment of signing my marriage contract.
What simplified? My mother?
Look at your brothers who are going to bring us down!
Ouch, harmful, but stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
But this is based on our budget, it works.
Leave this thing for the wives to eat.
He wants to laugh at us.
Frankly, I'm not pleased with my opinion.
This type is an open class, specific to the higher society.
About average.
No, we want something special, something no one can afford.
I beg your pardon, madam, you cannot hold someone responsible for what they do not know (term).
Lock, just lock, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't harm us, pay with a credit card.
What a classy guy, he's very innovative.
Yesterday, he signed a marriage contract.
Armed Nasser!
I'm available to you, I'm available to you.
This is coming towards you.
They completed the reservation for the small cabin and the food was suspect.
Very windy.
What she said about the Saadian marriage.
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
My loving sister,
He is only interested in money.
He cares about what people say.
He wants to laugh at us.
But we're supposed to provide something based on our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people take loans, sell their homes and cars just to have a lavish wedding and prevent people from talking about them?
Leave it to us; the bitter chocolate is enough to deceive us.
She said the director was impressed with her and took her home.
Undoubtedly, if the bride's family says that we chose the cabin, the theater, and we prepare everything alone.
And you think we'll choose anything!
No, something, but the store we go to early has a good price.
Since he designed this store, Abu Thahb got married.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, once.
At the wedding of His Excellency's daughter Mubarak.
No, no, no, we don't need anything that's been used.
I need stages that we were the first to use in the world.
This means you want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This technique was used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Updated and very recent.
How much does this stage cost with the other arrangements?
I'll calculate it for you now, but it's not less than one hundred and twenty thousand.
Father, by doing that, we won't suffice with our money; everything is majority, better, and distinguished, and all of that costs money.
Everyone loves it.
Please stop.
What's your decision?
So, did you like this?
This is Noah's boat.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is 20 thousand cheaper.
No, for the sake of what God has entrusted to your family, I think the mouse stage is better.
Lock, no, I need Noah's Ark.
This is a marriage and its costs. That's it, we're considered middle class.
Do I have to pay an amount for a 150,000 room and a 150,000 dressing room, that room that I booked as the "Royal Party Room" as you call it?
I didn't say box, but why this exposure and everyone tries to see each other and everyone strives to surpass what others have done.
This is a turf war, and it only benefits the owners of the marriage centers.
Those who know that everyone wants to be special, exploit us and deny us.
I swear I know one friend who says his brother has a wedding restaurant.
He said the theater ticket was no more than two thousand riyals.
I'm waiting for the moment when Father says yes.
Undoubtedly, do something.
Like the rest of the males who marry and organize themselves.
Hello ma'am, okay.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's the reason I called you.
First time in Qatar, designed by the international artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the Solar System.
With the stages of Noah's ship, it will be amazing.
There is no such balance; you will be the first to use the nine planets in Qatar.
Undoubtedly
It was one hundred and fifty thousand and now?
Undoubtedly
I promise, God will make it easy for you.
As You Like It (Revised)
Too many expenses, my brother.
Since I couldn't get all eighteen thousand.
All I've gathered is sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother, Fahd.
How do I fix things, Fahd? As long as we're displaying in marriage, there's a problem.
Without showing.
Of course, you'll get the invitations you want.
Yes, this week, God willing, we start the campaign.
Our marriage will be better than theirs.
Wax, look at the invitations your son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike our mother's family, she went to Italy to design her invitations, had them printed, and then returned. The same for Monira's family.
They moved to France, even people who don't have money go to Libya to weave their prayers.
The system works like this in the country, do you want us to be different?
So, which country do you want to travel to?
We saw some amazing invitations.
Indeed, expensive, but...
But it's private and there are no previous achievements.
Oil, I don't like it.
Gold would be better, shining.
Oh! My brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
So what made him participate?
And leave all this applause and boasting about marriage and all these costs that are useless.
What benefits from our illness are the hotels and wedding planners.
That is, he leaves, sad for him.
I'll take it, someone might not find anyone to take it.
Sure, I'll read it.
Thank you, Abu Nasser.
Hello, brother, the bride's family should support you.
I tried once, just once.
I told them that a dance floor is not needed in a famous hotel.
Why did we find our daughter on the streets while others didn't?
This is the problem, everyone is looking at the other.
Who told you I inherited?
At least they don't lack optimism.
It's all about a simple party and some small expenses.
Oh human, nowadays they announce marriages on Facebook.
Cheaper and less costly.
This means you won't be deported from your country.
Forget it, do you want me to go crazy?
You will see.
If I don't bring Abdullah Rawaisa or Nawal to my son's wedding contract.
He insulted her; he won't become better than me.
I want to ask you something nice.
If your son is registered with a Raayis number, give it to us so we can contact him.
Fine, dear, thank you very much, goodbye.
Dad, we agreed on the price, why did you change your mind?
Is Umm Nasseer better than me?
Did you forget who she is and who we are?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That doesn't look like mom, but watch out for my brother Salem, he breaks my heart and we're giving him a little pressure.
Indeed, he broke my heart.
Oh, really!
In the hospital! Any time and any hospital.
I don't know, it suddenly got stuck.
She heard him and collapsed.
He had no points, and could not be held responsible, after he had prepared everything, and taught people, he simply said he did not want a marriage.
He wants to harm us.
What did the doctor say?
He will harm us, he wants to annul the marriage.
And I hope things go smoothly.
Don't break her heart.
Oh! Your son, you are a man and need allowances.
Go, go and forget her.
I swear, if I told Abu Yusuf that, it would stop his heart from beating.
You know why the minister has kept Abu Yusuf until now.
Since then, he should have resigned three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong with it, it will help me.
I swear to you, you're crazy.
Did you understand what I want from him now?
And you consider it lawful to conceal the facts and evidence, until you take the wealth from him.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I don't speak, and I don't know the reason for your tension.
No need to worry, I'll return the amount to you when I'm done.
Do you know what they call me, do you know what they call me?
Spacious, spacious.
Brother, brother, I tried, but there's no other way but this.
If I give you one later,
They are strict in review, they will rush me, quickly, quickly.
Fast, mobile, mobile, mobile.
I ate, I ate the paper.
No, no, God willing, we'll be in the cabin from 7:30 to receive guests.
No, we will definitely work there.
I will hold a wedding for my son that will be the talk of every town.
Surprise!
No, Fatima. I'll talk to you later.
I'm nervous for you that they'll compete with you, son, if you go in there tomorrow all cocky.
So, Mom, is the length of the dress okay?
The police are here!
Since nothing is wrong.
Police, just stay here and I'll be back.
God is sufficient for you, Soloh.
Forget about your marriage.
Marriage in prison, now he will be transferred to prison.
They discovered the document you were hiding for your loan, and now they have discovered it.
Why are you laughing?!
You'll hear bigger than this every time.
What is said in this case!
A respectable and honest employee.
He who loves his work, bought the ministry a contract with a maintenance company.
The employee, due to his anxiety about the work, go and ask him about the materials.
I discovered that the cost is four million.
It will save the ministry a million and six hundred thousand.
And the moving one rationalizes it! No, no, no, I don't believe him.
Why don't you believe him!
Here is Saad.
Of course he has all the news.
He fired him from his job.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he contacted his office manager.
And tell him: Do it instead of Uthman.
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the manager in the same company that submitted the maintenance bid.
Which Uthman did you discover?
No, no, no, no, this is amazing.
You're always surprised, Sallem!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
We have become like this!
What you say!
The reason is not in what I say, this simple worker Uthman, what's wrong?!
His faults are that he is honest and truthful!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he left a while ago.
What a problem in the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree, Osman doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do.
It is not fair, my lord, he has seven children and does not have a passport.
This work pays well! What will he do now and what will he move on to?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee hired by the minister.
I entered Uthman's office and started working. Uthman arrived to collect his things, and I stood in front of him and said, "Go, and I will send your things with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Things have changed, haven't they, Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is the will of God.
Praise be to Allah the Great.
The great, merciful God, O Imran, will not abandon you, welcome.
What? What? Can't you hear me well!
I know, I know you're allergic.
It doesn't work! I can't do it, I'm leaving now.
It's an opportunity to pass by my wife and offer the coffee.
I don't want you to stay this tense.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How is it allowed, by what right do you go with him? Is he your husband, or your father, or your brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
I don't know my mother!
You're crazy.
People are liberated, the world has become a small village, where do you live?
But what can we say!
Be contemporary, live in the present and be proactive.
Get the thing from the car quickly! Go, don't look at me and lock it.
What happened? Hey, ladder, what happened to you?
No, today it didn't improve.
You're yelling at the poor worker, she didn't do anything wrong.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I don't have a passion.
I can't forget the disasters I've seen.
Oh my friend, don't cry.
The president is a bit tense.
We are proud to serve you.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Working hard and steadily.
Correct, and so on.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Of course, ma'am!
I ask myself, what's the use of an employee who doesn't accept a bonus?
This is excessive.
That's why I want all of you.
No place for honest, principled, and broad-minded people.
If you ever find yourself
He will only punish himself.
Justice is a principle regardless of interaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
I'm telling you.
We are accelerators and the son of an accelerator, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nour doesn't take a bribe one day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, congratulations!
God bless you.
This is the reason I want you to leave the supply department and become my office manager.
Frankly, knowing the abstraction, you've chosen the right accelerator for the right place.
Enough, Saad, enough, won't you stop wasting my time?
I don't want to live in a prison.
But God is sufficient for me, who has delivered me from the hand of the king; He has shown me His goodness.
And tell him to be honest.
You are my father.
Why bother with truth and honesty?
All your life you've been a speeder and a wrecker.
Excellent that I didn't become a hypocrite.
I'm speaking with your father.
Never do it.
He must be on the straight path, cheat, steal, and be fake to live easily.
The father is detained because all his money is illegal.
It ends, it ends.
Is this something you wear!
We are an extended family.
You are denied.
Where is your stomach?
Why isn't it revealed?
Don't feel guilty, you're a vent.
I'm embarrassed to wear a brother.
Is there any girl feeling shy today?
Why are you screaming?
Look at what your daughter is wearing!
Is there a good woman who wears something like this?
And you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I'm tired of her, she doesn't listen to what I say.
I haven't always voiced my support here.
I bought her some unnecessary see-through clothes.
I warn you, if you ever see me below the knee.
Since you know the situation, don't punish me for the results.
"We are here, God bless you."
Since he is likely to be both playful and tough.
He is like his father.
As you can see in front of you,
He's an excellent man, how do we find someone like this?
Don't worry, Dad, I'm cunning.
An excellent man. To tell the truth, I love my daughter Sarah very much and care about her future.
Let's avoid it after we heard about it.
Thank God, it's owned by a wicked lady.
I returned home at 3:30 in the night.
I arrived at her house at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
I paid and left the restaurant.
Start the car engine and drive to tell me from where.
This is the first time I've seen a parent who doesn't obey their child.
"It's enough, Dad. Start the car, I'm waiting for you."
Mary, I love you.
I love you surely, disappear, disappear, disappear.
Generally, generally, my father, the father here.
Where is he?
He is abstract, different from my father, who is not entertaining.
I'm introducing you to my life partner, Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my former partner.
Welcome, come in, opportunity for development.
Arab and Israeli satellites
It was discovered that many Palestinians did not cut their fingers.
In accordance with the commitments of the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations meets today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to inspect Palestinian fingers.
To test if their nails are long or not.
The condition was that nothing should be cut, wounded, or bleed.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Made from concentrate.
Avocado, human.
We pour oil like this, this is how we pour oil.
We call on the international community and our Arab brothers.
Checking Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't reach that level, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Year, year, what happened to you?
What did I see?
I dreamed of an upside-down world.
Oh! Rashid, you need to have a strong personality.
Now, brother, the school you will work at tomorrow is number?
I am a teacher like you.
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
What's your personality, brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
Since the teachers who were with him were the ones who criticized him.
To that extent, brother!
This is the reason he appears calm.
Then he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was 100% mayonnaise.
Hello, brother. We're not talking to you to make you tense.
We're telling you this is your last chance.
And he told me that I was a mature person, even though he was a weak character.
He is hesitant and average.
Whoever persists in it becomes a relative.
Why is he silent? Your brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
New teacher.
Mr. Rashid,
You are completely right.
Alright, let's forget about it.
And from tomorrow,
Sure, this is good, and what's next?
Here I tell you,
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
We say that a boy stands and conveys to you what the other boy said at the previous school, and the inspector is present.
And I'll take your right!
Slowly, slowly, the door is broken.
Undoubtedly, he learns from his mistakes.
From the very first moment,
Here I tell you,
I'm nervous.
This is on my shoulders!
Stop!
It seems he just said, "Shut up!"
Did I hear him?
My lord Rashid informed him that he had dismissed me.
It seems he told me not to care, but he'll see, I don't want to see your face here in class.
Doctor, do you know who he is?
Who is the son of whom?
There goes Mr. Rashid.
Did I see him?
Doctor, the problem is that if he tells his father.
Blash, where do you usually see him = sitting, sitting during the break?
You might find him sitting in the chair area.
On familiarity.
Chairs, chairs.
He's human at the end of the day.
But you complained about me!
Friends, as they laugh, you laugh at me.
Father is out and I will be back next week, and if he asks I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdurrahman, God protect you.
We, we are friends. On the other hand, the strawberry cream is excellent, you might try it. It has a slight tang, but it's excellent.
Go and get it quickly.
The only thing I fear is that my father will find out.
She said her father was out of the country.
Yes, he's out of the country. His father won't return? Meaning they took his father's things and expelled him!
I hope there won't be serious consequences.
You carried his bag and got it for him, gave him your phone number, and told him, "If you need anything, call me, I'm your friend."
Yes, but.
Yes, but what?
You're the one who told me.
Proclaim and claim that you are strong.
The bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom.
Oh! Rashid!
Grow, grow, grow, don't cling, grow.
Sixth, Abu Nasser, Rashid in the bathroom.
One juice, please.
Auto, auto, auto, auto, give me.
Go, quickly.
I put them on the table.
That everyone is equal.
That's why I've gathered you, to hear your opinions about the party.
How does anyone insure a boy?
This will get us into trouble, he claims.
At three o'clock.
Which means, hello. Pick up the phone, I swear he's laughing.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand for inspection, sit down.
Yes, I'm with you.
Ah! Teacher, move, move, ah! Teacher.
Have you finished clapping?
I'm not laughing, man, but I'm asking, are you done??
Have you finished or not? Where is the teacher's reputation? By doing that, you degrade yourself and degrade the teaching profession.
Undoubtedly, fine, accepted, accepted.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I raise my voice, first you must know who is this boy?
Faster, faster.
Less than two cars.
Four or five cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Spread out, spread out, we have plenty of space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
In the name of God, He protects.
I'm the boss here.
Is known as Abu Nasser
It is used to provide extra portions for all teachers.
Except me.
Who is the manager here?
You are the manager, I hope God guides you, what's wrong with you?
Remove your leg.
I didn't put it in your head, it's on the chair, brother!
What do you mean?
No need, I swear I'm honest, I want to ease your burden.
What do they call it?
So, what do we do with you now?
Conduct yourself better, and you will get extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you? Run, run, run, get out!
No, I'll go out.
As you will, we have said to you, O man.
We must put him in his place.
Wait, my fellow citizens, wait.
Do not punish us, Abu Salman.
Oh! Abu Naif, you're the neighborhood's guardian, and it's your duty to prevent him from crossing the line.
I am not my father's son.
You will see what I will do to him.
Faster, faster.
Welcome, sir.
Wow, when did I buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He removed the tick and his face turned red.
Do you believe that when she came, I didn't recognize her, but when she spoke, I recognized her from her voice.
Did you know he was promoted last week?
That is, he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? He asked him to tell you, what is the secret that pulled him out from the bottom!
I've been telling you since day one,
When I am informed, I do not want to hear a sound.
And no spitting.
Answer with your behavior.
And you respond to me, you argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you are appointed as a minister, look for a good job alongside.
So, what are you saying I should do to get this job?
Neither the other job, no man gives me options, different jobs, and I choose the most suitable job.
My father is a minister!
I swear, I didn't feel good after the call I received.
Everyone is congratulating me.
What is called a mother, God fills you with.
This is very common. Each minister automatically employs his friends and people.
From this side, don't worry, happy to meet you %Pw.
They know I'll become a minister.
So, they are converting me, this is certain.
An exporter will come to us, a queen, a queen will come to us.
The big earth.
Go, each one of you go to celebrate the new minister.
So we go, we go, we go.
Congratulations, Your Excellency, the Minister.
"By your mercy, a download."
Congratulations, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Mr. Minister.
Brothers, the responsibility is great, God helps us to assume it.
As they say, you're cut out for this job (term).
She woke up later after listening to Abu Salim's phone.
She was far from him.
Forget him.
I'm surprised to see how much he loves it now?
And Abu Sultan must commit.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Go, you've done too much!
We're waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I've told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they were restaurant stories, restaurant stories.
After her husband's death, she said, "I feel sad about my husband."
God does not tolerate, God does not tolerate.
Yes, don't say anything, you don't have anything.
Mother, let's go, I'm utterly exhausted.
What does it mean that it's none of your business?
Enough is what you have left with tranquility.
I stopped them because they were making me nervous.
Yes, they are correct.
But I didn't dare say it in front of my mother, she knows my mother will tell everyone.
She said everything you hear, they call her the troublemaker, we don't want any surprises.
So, what assurances do you have that if he is removed from power, he won't put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's leaving the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What guarantees you that they will punish him?
No, I'm absolutely sure about this.
Don't recall, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of me.
You bewitch him.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
This is a plan he burned and carried out.
I'll make him attend every event that takes place in the country.
At this moment, he will collapse, and when he collapses, he will fall out of the office. And when he leaves the office, he will collapse from the place.
I swear, brother, I don't know how, and I don't know what to tell you!
Your dress code is named, and it reflects your love for your homeland.
Do you believe that?
You are responsible today, you must always be present.
You need to participate in everything, sorry sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
"They've arrived, sir, it's just a small spot, you can't reach it. Don't you think, sir, will you come with me today?"
The man is waiting for you outside the building!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am sick of excellence, I am sick of excellence.
You are the minister today, that's right. As he said, you are known for the meetings, keep your reputation!
God sends you this good man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Took, took
Today I took him to the poetry night and wedding, and they took more than a hundred pictures of him.
I'll also tell you about something very beautiful you can take him to.
Listen, I've organized an excellent educational activity for you.
Yes, like that. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it lights up. I'm looking for that color.
Seller, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, Mubarak roundabout. %PW Picture, picture, your happiness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take a picture of me, I'm far away, take it.
This is a bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, His Excellency welcomes you.
Image, image, and so it is. You are vast, vast in your sanctity.
Nothing, God bless you.
Go to page two.
No, he doesn't know about it.
This is a national contribution.
Say what God wills.
This is the fourth friend who called me today.
Everyone praises your activity; Umm Khalid calls you the active one in the community.
Yesterday, I heard a hurtful word.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
A celebration for the young children's swimming victory.
There was a person telling his friend,
They thought I didn't hear them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my little brother.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, every day in the newspaper.
Correct, correct,
You brought light when you came to this store, I'll give a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, no problem.
This means you won't go and work with your minister.
I am Abu Salah, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't come to bite, I'm waiting for him.
He put me in the front row, then went to the car to relax.
We don't need anything from him, may God guide you.
I hope God keeps you safe, woman, with your family. I'll check on you later.
And you call upon [Allah] by His name.
People give us discounts.
I told you.
This work is excellent.
But let this person come and get me!
His happiness annoys me; his minister might offend God.
Hello, welcome, Your Excellency, the Minister.
No, but I'm tired today and
No problem, if you're excited, we're ready for you.
We'll serve you, but my brother Saad will accompany you and move with you, and I hope he finds you a party or something.
Then, group?
No, no, today we don't have any activities.
No, we don't have it.
Blash, where can we find?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is anyone asking?
Go, may God make it easy for you.
Sleep and rest.
One happy moment.
Is there anything going on until Hina's night?
Sure, that's good.
It might be extra time.
Bring him! Take him into the room and find a photographer to take pictures of his face.
No, no, Moody.
What did I find for him?
I don't know, a match in the reserve league. Let him stay alone on the field!
What is this! This minister has touched us!
Excellent, that means he reached the summit.
His death was a death that reached the realm of death, and his death was acquiring death itself.
My lord, he has become more popular than you.
My lord, if you went to a place and took Abdus-Salam with you,
Hello, sir.
The star is twinkling.
We'll stop using it and reshape it to its regular size.
The minister called, called, called. The minister called.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll destroy it. I'm not coming out.
Brock destroys their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, it's a train wreck.
This is my brother Khalid.
He owns nothing except for the sake of God.
Why is this?
This is the first time I see her.
The first time you see it!
The first time I've seen her in years.
Welcome, my Lord.
Is this Khaldoun?
I haven't seen you in a long time, call me dear.
What is done? He is very attached to her.
There is no power or authority except from God, it boils down to the same problem.
Take, take and do not give me harm, I came from the wedding at 3 o'clock.
Simply let me rest, even if you're not rested.
Your sister is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my dad, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
This means that he was playing, playing.
Yes, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with makeup.
And I know what to do with Saud.
Khalid is tormented, I wish all children were like him.
About this campaign and the strange way he creates around his brother.
Come here, my loving brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, my love?
No, my dear, we won't be going to Spain this summer.
So who are you talking to?
He is from Kuwait.
Hello, friends!
Listen to my words.
He owns nothing except for the sake of God.
I will let the loving kindness choose by itself.
But really, what do you think?
I say the theorist is better off looking at the sea.
Because in the near future, if we buy a ship, we will go directly from our home to the sea.
Us and our sons.
Please specify the wedding date.
No problem, a year and a month or two is fine.
What's wrong with your brother, he uses too much perfume.
He hoped sincerely, I noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or similar, dear, everyone is already allowed.
And you, in your marriage, in your marriage, you do not know that there is a consistent scent.
Keep your opinion to yourself!
I don't care.
I don't believe him, Khalid!
What perfume do you use that smells like a woman's?
You even use their colors.
Why do you do that, Khalid?
Frankly, you have nothing to say.
Mother, why don't you refuse to believe in something unless you observe its behavior and actions?
Now perfumes are gender-neutral.
Here I warn you.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard from my friends in the council that it is very prevalent in Doha.
I heard it, show it to us.
You need to watch her, and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the native speakers!
Those girls! I saw the girl you say dances simply and performs movements. Do you know who she is? She is the sister of Khalid Mahdi's brother.
One is the cousin of my free uncle.
Good, you'll see what I'll do to him.
I'm waiting for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him come and you'll see, let Saad come! I'll send him a Bluetooth, so he can watch his family.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, I lost.
Why are my brothers sitting apart?
Nothing, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, ma'am.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
And he will travel tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going alone?
What is said about people?
They will say that their son left them and traveled, you won't cause a dispute for us!
Oh, really?
What your son Khalid did is an honor and a pride!
The man who turned himself into a woman, is he a problem?
I can't interact with people if it's said that this is for those who love them.
Tell him he travels for treatment, or study, or work, or even to kill himself.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where shame chases me every day.
So, where are we going?
I don't care where I go (slang).
This is the end.
We don't know where the other one is, and the one who is here is getting ready to travel.
Not even we know where he goes?
What did they expect from him?
What's wrong with you? I keep you to give me comfort, and you pay me back with harsh words that break my heart.
I was telling you to make sure you're in touch with him.
Don't leave it to families.
You don't know anything about it and you're wasting your time.
My father is busy with his work and I leave the task to you.
You are right, Mom.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are correct.
What Khadija did insulted us in front of people.
I can't watch anyone.
Did you tell him anything?
This is my father's biggest flaw.
We are in the matter of Khalid the Stranger.
I didn't tell him.
Put it in two balls and send it to him.
Since I'm going to the airport.
I'm nervous for him.
You must reach our house to that extent, O Amal.
Don't be surprised.
Khaled and his companions, they don't care about their families' reputations.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
As long as religious values have named them.
And they move, and they move, and they move
In the clear water.
Frankly, son, I'm hesitant.
Goodbye, Father.
Take care of yourself, my son!
Yes, Father, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put it on the computer, I'm afraid of what will happen, follow me!
No, Mother.
I can't believe the father is still watching the cassette, it's only three minutes.
He may go out.
Where is he going? He doesn't have time to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Father!
Improved, hey! Amal
If I search, I will fail.
To find someone with the same morals,
But forgive me.
In the name of God, He seeks your ease.
I see you entering the attic!
Yes, dear.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and we are not supposed to expect anything from anyone.
If anyone has a riyal, it's enough for him to take a thousand! Oh my dear!
Of course I can handle him. God bless America, dear.
Do you know that wages are high now?
This is one thousand twenty.
God is sufficient for you; every time you ask the driver, "How much is your salary?"
My salary is very low.
Whenever he sees me, he starts complaining. My salary is low and there are no benefits. We agreed with him that his salary would be seven hundred and we increased it by a hundred when he got the license. What more does he want?
I told him, when a year of work is completed, we will raise your salary.
It seems spacious, and we'll have difficulties with it.
End, end, disappear, vanish, vanish, remove it and forget it.
This talk is easy for you, just easy.
So you'll let him complain, I hate going with him in the car.
Without a doubt, keep it in mind.
You've made your point, I'm the man of the house. Shut up, stop, you shut up, I'll handle this.
Rise, I want you out, rise!
Connect and listen.
What did I tell you?
You told your friends not to enter your room. Did you say that or not?
Sir, this is not my friend, this is my brother.
He came for five minutes and I will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
Keep it in mind!
Don't tell me I need a raise in salary, I need a raise in salary!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when I presented you with eight hundred?
Sir, I have a lot of issues behind me.
Drivers in Doha earn one thousand and one, one thousand and two.
It could be three hundred and three.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll lift 100% of the impossible, I won't lift you.
Don't say you're over a hundred, act!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
There is no benefit in a hundred.
No use in 200.
I'm afraid of screens.
Why are you afraid?
All drivers are mounted.
Because they work outdoors for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work from home, you don't benefit, but when you work outside the home, you make more money.
I'm very scary.
Look at them, they are all travelers.
How much?
One thousand five hundred.
But I'm afraid the police will take me and transfer me to prison.
No, don't be afraid.
I assure you.
I was wearing my pajamas and I went out.
I was calling and now he's answering.
He took hold of his cup, but the store was empty.
The Monira dynasty succeeded for a year.
I will only say, God is sufficient for him.
Without a doubt, I will go to you.
I went to the police.
If you report, you bear no responsibility.
We're doing everything we can.
As you look around yourself and the place, you might see it and alert us.
Yes, it will generate profit, and when it's done, it will introduce itself.
We provide for them, spend on them, and give them clothes, food, and car training.
It doesn't fall on his shoulders.
The game starts now, join, join is best.
Yes, we were nervous.
These four and the four were not repelled easily.
You know that if we don't score more than three, it means we haven't won, we need ten or fifteen.
This is clearly absurd, clearly absurd. Let's be clear, this is clearly absurd.
This is the level of the team. If they don't score more than three goals, it's not the Fox team.
I'm telling you.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, they complain to God if the temperature goes above three, they complain to God.
Any goal, this is an application. Our team is still hungry, this is the Fox team, leave us alone, man.
You have a purpose now, and you are comfortable and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals, or does it stop here?
This fox is excellent, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can deter it, you'll be exposed. This fox eats chicken.
No, no, I have a vehicle.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
He said that this philosopher is a big problem.
You can't hit it.
Yes, sir.
Do you know him or not?
He is a Rabbit team fan.
He sometimes appears on the show "Recharge Yourself."
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear to defeat you. The Feather Team never loses, it's always the winner.
Coach, what's your opinion on today's result?
Why did you ask me about the result?
Over, Foxes win.
The birds came to live and let die.
Stay realistic, don't say Fix won and flew away.
These are rabbits, my friend.
This elephant eats chicken.
You didn't see the respect your actions earned you on the field.
People can't stop laughing at him.
This is clear on the field, and thank you for listening.
The real player who has true loyalty to the club.
It is collected with the top readers who go to the markets and places.
Invite me for a cappuccino.
What a mysterious world, man!
The child handed me 500 riyals and paid the bill.
Share the poem you wrote about our encounter with the worms.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are alive.
Don't feel bad that your team lost to us by four.
Talk to Bessa, talk to Bessa about the team and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the rabbits was expelled.
The reason for that is a supervisor.
Remove a player from the Fox team.
I'm changing his name from Observer to Madman.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month we meet to choose the best lover.
Excellent, who did I choose to admire this month?
The club board members will be the ones to make the decision.
All of you are adults and are like camels.
I manage this big club. Thaloub.
Come, come and see the man who escaped us, he's on TV, come.
Is this it?
One of them speaks well, and the other is taciturn.
In your opinion, is it a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get there.
The assembly has exited.
Follow him.
He's back there.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Excellent!
Lock up, don't decide, I'm the man of the house and I'll decide.
We must be certain.
Majd Abdel Rahman Al-Sabji
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Subay tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I already have a house.
I just want to invest.
As the investment price rises, God blesses you.
How can I assist you, folks? What do you need?
God bless you.
Come in, family, want some coffee?
Don't say anything, congratulations, you don't need anything, congratulations from God.
You say surely, is that acceptable? Where are we beaten in front of the rich!
I'm very nervous.
Mother, mother, I am a mother.
Now, what will your father do with us? I don't know.
I didn't mean it, Mom!
I beg you, Mom, don't tell Dad.
My father is turning the house upside down.
Of course they will kill you now.
Mom, I didn't put it there on purpose.
So, Mom, why don't we buy some glue and stick them together?
What should we keep, girl?
How do we find something like it? I don't know where to buy it. Your brother, it was a gift.
I'm nervous about you through it.
Mom, I'm afraid he'll hit me.
Close the door until I find a solution to this matter.
Hurry, go to your room.
Arrogant, arrogant, arrogant! Are you arrogant!
Are you prone to breaking down over shattered glass, are you prone?
Mom, did Waleed call you?
No, my daughter, he didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This is not true. Take care of your son!
This is not upbringing, God may guide you, daughter!
What is being done now, mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but he turned himself around from the cars on the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the market or went to his neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, he is beloved, kind, and beloved, O daughter!
No, my daughter, seek protection from the devil and do not worry, hope that everything will be alright.
No, wait, daughter.
Where is Waleed?
The father will tell me.
The girl, I will kill myself from my father's beating.
Don't worry, my dear.
Don't worry, my love!
I don't allow him to hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son, widen your chest and drink a little water and hold on to my pigeon.
Your face has turned yellow.
In the name of God, in the name of God, come with me, my son, for a little while.
Welcome, great God.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
I'm coming, son, don't worry.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I will raise him the way I want.
But the needy person buys anxiously, hesitantly, and fearfully something they never intended to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Lower it!
The bag bumped into the pot by accident, believe me, he didn't mean it.
You! You must support him!
Don't say anything to him for me, forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where is he, where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
He won't be here.
This is here! Where?
Enter, enter!
No, no, I'll take it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something different from the old thing!
I'm done, let's play, brother!
And my sister says you study!
Just this game and then we study!
Do you have a test tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Go, father, and forget the game.
Go, my father, die, do not lower me to the bed. Go, go, my father, we will learn.
What are you saying! Listen to me,
If you don't change, I'll call your brother Abu Walid right now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my brother, don't tell my brother, no!
I don't care.
I'll tell him you don't obey me.
Go, each one take his book and start studying.
No, Father, put my phone in your pocket, let's study, Father, but don't tell my brothers.
The girl is really crazy. I don't know what to do?
I'm afraid if he knows, it will cause us a problem.
Of course, he will ask me: "Why are you taking him to the hospital?"
So, what's the problem if I tell him?
If he finds out Walid is peeing on his bed, he'll kill him.
Oh! Mom, it's him who's causing the problem. It's all his responsibility.
Oh! Daughter, it's psychological.
The boy belongs to Mr. Sid. He is now 12 years old.
Improved, daughter!
She will come to have dinner with us and I will give him some advice.
And I will see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy poems.
This is just a justification (term), daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She says he prays every night in his bed.
My son prays every night in his bed, and don't tell me the story.
He said that I need to take him to the hospital so he can recover.
Her husband is crazy.
He doesn't understand anything.
It is correct.
They must take him to the doctor, son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
He was looking for a good dry wire.
He beat him until the last person in the area heard his screams.
Sit down!
Eat! Daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly. Wash yourself, and I'll give you some clothes. Go!
I beg of you, please.
I need to punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you call it a name?
Khaled scored 49 out of 50.
Is this a ticket?
But their grades are good.
He told them that you will be punished if you don't get fifty out of fifty.
Please don't let them meet my brother!
They must be punished.
They are my sons.
Undoubtedly, I swear, O father, O father, this is the last time.
When you find 50 out of 50, 50 out of 50?
Give him another one.
I tell him, don't go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the clinic and they told him not to enter, entry was prohibited.
You're special, don't go with us.
Stop! Let me punish his brother.
Stop it, my father, once and for all, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, once and for all, stop it, my father.
I will punish you.
Remember, this is not a punishment. What you see at the end of the year, if none of you get fifty.
I'll drain the pool.
I will fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will end tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman
Sure, Khalid, very good!
Abdullah Rashid is asking.
Excellent, Faiez!
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and your rank is second in the class.
The doctor is crying because he got 49 out of 50 in math.
The doctor is afraid of his father because he wants him to get 50 out of 50.
You, my son, I am speaking to you!
Call, call his colleague.
He said he saw himself by the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's house.
No, he didn't go there.
So, where is he? Where is he?
He has no power except from Allah.
What did he simplify? Ah! The brother?
Ah, of course he fails and is afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail; on the contrary, he is an excellent student and was second in his class.
But he was afraid to go home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
To die in peace.
The hand, the hand.
The hand, the hand.
Oh! Waleed has left.
Eighty-four, seventy-four, you've lost one or two marks, never mind. I won't say anything, I won't warn you or hit you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Great, the Most Merciful.

Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Ibrahim ibn Hamād al-Aṭīyah
And those who wish to participate can contact us on the display's contact numbers.
Mr. Advisor, hello and welcome.
I want to start with you about the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where will prices drop?
Of course, where prices will end up is a complicated question.
Or what we call market power.
Is it "that" or "by the Lord"?
And not the producing countries?
Besides producer states, OPEC is not responsible for oil pricing.
Is this the only relationship between price, supply, and demand?
So far, there is no great relationship between supply and demand with this.
So what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
That made investors
I feel a lot of pressure and turned to oil and gold, or what is called "commercial marketing."
Investments lost their confidence in stock markets.
Precious stones as well.
We have seen gold rise from $350 in past years up to $970 now.
And to this day, as I mentioned before, about one hundred and nine dollars.
But they all rise, and if they fall, it will be a gentle decline.
I remind you that the first quarter of this year
The second quarter in which prices will drop due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in winter prices and its consumption have now changed and other factors have emerged.
And economic growth
And at the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
I pointed to political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation is in light of political tensions?
Who followed and currently led the activities of most American newspapers and the context of global journalism. It may affect oil prices.
Yes 100% and tomorrow too.
Today, we are in an era of global expansion, and the impact is showing rapidly.
Unrealistic factors may influence.
And created a kind of disturbance in the market.
And created some types of political news.
He said there was no plan, but he did not rule out other options that could be applied to Iran.
Markets always return to volatility.
Of course, there is nothing confirmed that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who do not see this situation.
And there may be things we have not seen. What will happen in the future?
But we, who work in the energy sector
We observe that these political tensions
In the world's oil resources
On the other hand, there are very profitable supplies.
This indicates that there is oil being stored.
And there is absolutely no shortage of oil resources.
Perhaps in preparation for the next war.
Under this insurance policy you are referring to regarding the supply, and that there are no obstacles in the supply.
If President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will get higher and you'll get special records.
Oil prices may rise.
From the global oil reserves
You are here, today the gulf represents great importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Today they represent more than 60% of the oil reserves, and that is certain.
You today
If a very small accident happened.
Therefore, it indicates.
In other words, any war with Iran means there are no guarantees to the extent that oil prices will rise.
God knows that this day may come, we arrived without realizing it.
War for $107 and $110, and it may rise to $110, God knows.
Yesterday oil, as I told you, lived under political and psychological tensions.
And investors took note of these tensions.
An investor only in oil.
Or what is called "of course no real investment is executed whether it's futures buying or futures marketing"
And the paper used in the oil industry is considered
And it's all guesswork in the oil paper.
All its production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
These people might be pushed to buy more than just an upgrade.
I want April to be the April of wonders.
I hope it doesn't happen.
It is said that China will return to the region, and that is one of his main priorities.
The Chinese is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I don't know what's in the Chinese bag.
And I don't expect what will be in it, meaning I
Will he ignite the war?
The United States is in a transitional phase.
And what would the builder do otherwise?
Let's see what happens. If we're talking about April, it's only a few weeks away, and we'll be in April soon.
And the world may pay
And America is a big consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
Don't throw away this number.
The cost of their production is very low.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can
We learned every year, from the West and the United States, its secrets.
Use
Remember the story of the Battle of the Caspian Sea?
What phenomena do you imagine?
When you sit with Westerners in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different manner.
What's being said?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of the inventory.
When I asked a European official, I said, "It's strange that you're talking among us behind closed doors."
Not in the same way you speak in front.
Or the media said: for political reasons.
It is natural that there are what are called double standards or two languages.
The language you know that the Gulf countries speak is Arabic.
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And his entry.
Despite all this
Head of the Central Region
Start a war with Iran.
Even with an air war or air attack, as they say.
In stock
You are not late, you are very early.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
We don't deal with the West.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of this national loyalty to the market
I mean, non-renewable energy.
For the sake of (between parentheses) kindness
Arab benevolence
Go and call him for me.
Observers say that the real price of oil
The cause of the rise in oil prices
You are the citizens of the Gulf, the OPEC organization, and the states.
You are very lenient with Americans, and insist on keeping their currency.
She said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the real price compared to the falling U.S. dollar is sixty to seventy.
Sure, the price is one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped by thirty percent.
And now it has exceeded one hundred dollars.
If we take the percentage and the relative proportion
No one denies that.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This is a comparison.
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it's beneficial for us at the moment for the dollar to decrease.
Weakness or decline in America's economy, the United States cannot "do anything."
Therefore, what happened was economic weakness and contraction.
You are all in their hearts.
The United States reduces benefits in dollars.
Why emphasize the link between oil and the dollar?
Let's talk about why oil prices are tied to the dollar.
The first, more than 100 years
The first to export a barrel of oil was a source from the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars.
And he was of the number of the twenty for this day.
Pricing oil in dollars
In history, it became
And a hundred years ago, the world was punished and spread.
And where Norway is today considered the third-largest oil-producing country.
Oil export
Russian is the second-largest exporter of oil.
And the production of the North Sea field in Europe.
Prices are in dollars, not in.
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and news that indicate something different from this.
Located in the Gulf countries.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the true shadow.
This is true and there isn't any.
They are agreements.
As long as oil remains a cover for the dollar in transactions with the United States, these systems will continue to be covered.
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's take OPEC.
You have 66 percent of consistent actors.
Among twelve countries
Out of the 85 barrels, 40% are for OPEC.
There are many countries that are large producers of oil.
Outside OPEC
What are the barriers to pricing in another currency?
Search for prices in another currency.
Isn't this decided by the adults?
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states are hot heroes.
Today OPEC's share is like everyone's.
There are sixty percent.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a direction and an intention to change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the currency of the price.
Unless there is an agreement between
What's its effect?
I am now speaking about the reason for Europe.
Don't squeeze their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles
Because it is in their interest to have a high and expensive currency.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where they lost.
In European, it measures one and a half barrels.
No, you're the one who's losing, because your currency has depreciated since it's pegged to the dollar.
He is also a big loser, a great loss.
The banking association here in the Gulf has a historical link.
You remembered when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
And now you've hit the nail on the head when you talk about giving up.
It's like a marriage when we get married.
And if you want to quit, it's not easy.
No, here.
Or have you agreed to a Catholic marriage with the dollar?
And costs need to be studied in a way that
The evaluation was conducted professionally and verified.
And so Kuwait, dismantling 25% of the price of its imports.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
He can adjust the price of his currency.
Today about the subject but this means that you're not interested in studying the subject or thinking about it.
The inspection, of course, varies, as the Prime Minister explained.
He confirmed that Qatar's currency is 30% undervalued against its true value.
Be in this study.
There are no directions where you are the only ones going this way.
Kuwait has secured its position, when will it follow its path?
Economists say that profit is more beneficial to countries and their citizens than loss.
But we
And nothing else.
That these four Gulf states declare
Everyone believes.
And I mean who supports him personally.
He will support him.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
What has been created by one or two states
Until payday
So you won't save the situation now.
Of course, there are experts who will do this study.
And they will be the ones who will work.
Experts alone do not decide; this requires political will.
Let's wait and rule out haste for now, wait and see what happens today.
People started..., I mean
Of course, in coherence mode.
Sir, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 reached 14% and will reach 15% next year.
Overpaying people's salaries, and the erosion of workers' wages here.
The percentage of Qatari women who have been married at least once ranged from 35% to 40%.
We will contact you after the break to determine the extent of the wage increases.
We are based in Qatar for the foreseeable future, so stay tuned with us.
Welcome back "Without Borders" in this segment where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Qatar's Minister of Energy.
And the factories, Abdullah bin Hammed Al-Attiyah, about the sharp rise in prices.
In oil that brought back tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf countries and producing states.
From oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in workers' wages, but before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
The UAE 97 and 8 out of 10 billion and gets 2 and 6 out of 10.
Only spacious, and teach Kuwaiti she teaches economics, and the spacious families are one of the largest of them.
Saudi Arabia's expected profits in 2008 were $109 billion.
And it was
1017 last year, UAE 66 this year, and it was expected to be 75.
Kuwait 64 and Canada 54
Qatar twenty one oil plus five and fifty billion
It's not a gas, as other reports have said, and therefore there is no envy, I mean we are not envied on the helpful level.
Iraq 47 billion
2.5 billion
Regarding spending, it was worth 1.5 trillion dollars.
Gulf countries topped with 1000 billion, meaning trillion.
The dollar was a type of import.
The United States invests three hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
In Bahrain, it was 3%.
In 2007 in Oman it was 6.5 but it will increase to 7, and in Qatar it was 13.75 but it will increase to 15%.
This means that those living in Qatar can expect high living costs, with goods and prices being expensive.
Life is consumed, prices rise and reach hundreds of percent, and an increase in Qatar.
We understand everyone.
For the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to reduce inflation.
This means you will set their salaries with a 50% increase.
No, they will consider you opposed to raising wages.
What is correct?
And in the cabinet, against raising wages.
That there is a problem and its solution must be the ideal solution.
And a practical solution.
Sure, there's a balance between the two.
And it will be,,, that's all.
The past is the solution to inflation.
And in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Excellency issued a decree to form
And he works.
And work on building strong foundations.
To solve the problem and control inflation
What matters now is controlling inflation.
Price increase
If you don't control it
But Your Honor, now.
The one who specialized in market research and was published last February, a few days ago.
Among them because of wages for
Now the problem will be solved by landing and I will make inflation eat people's income.
Many of them now
Revenues to other countries
Raise our wages, then analyze inflation and reduce it again.
I reiterate what is said, that is, balancing the subject.
But now
And not with a temporary solution.
Add more of it.
Therefore, here.
To end inflation
Boredom will always remain.
Because the increase was enormous last year, wasn't it?
The second point is
Those who work in the private sector are not the same as those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
So now we must also look at this question of increase with justice.
I don't know where you got these statistics from.
We live in your majesty's Qatar, not in Germany.
I'm telling you today, on the contrary, that the private sector has started to pay.
More
Those who worked in government offices in Qatar moved to the private sector.
Due to high wages.
Facing a problem
Moving to the private sector because the private sector is more important and vital.
And he gives a good wage.
Tied to the power of the market called
Or market power.
They don't come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar has low wages or low expenses.
Or with costs they come.
Acceptable with our clear understanding
I don't expect an event and I'm not saying that wages will get higher.
There is no hope as it is.
To control inflation
Let's give him time.
Controlling inflation
And according to God's will, this is what the report said, that a train in 2008
God willing, we say that.
We notice that these numbers will become different.
Add a little of that to people.
Consistent and professional
Of course, professionally and all that.
From inflation
Because spending
A lot on different projects.
Allow me to take some questions from the audience, and I hope everyone will ask a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, brother Abdulaziz?
Built on the ruling families of the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think the cause is an OPEC contradiction.
Second: The total revenue from oil goes directly to the general manager.
Then for the royal family, and the rest will be spent on development.
Once accountability is absent, the status quo will remain.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Hello, Brother Ahmed
I won't belabor the point. The brother mentioned what concerns official systems and the issue of linking the Qatari Riyal to the Dollar or other Gulf currencies to the Dollar.
America wants to universalize the world and make it conform to its army.
The U.S. deficit reached $82 billion in Sino-U.S. trade.
However, the European Union with $68 billion
This means that all trends in global politics are contrary to the dollar.
And we are paying the price for that now as Arab countries and OPEC oil states.
It will end up as a confrontation between America.
And between the developed countries like China, Russia, and others, the issue might become complicated.
My nation is a reference.
The explosion of Chinese rockets, Russian rockets, Japanese rockets, and American rockets as well.
Thank you very much for this clarification and information.
Is your question for the engineer?
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Surely your question is...
But from what I saw, his happiness continued to go unanswered.
The issue of incompatibility with the dollar because the dollar is declining.
And according to God's will, I descended.
He is a good man.
The Arab situation of brotherhood should not be followed.
Thank you, Brother Mohamed, thank you. Now we ask for the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from the sector. Your question, Ahmed, is...
Good evening to you as well.
Thank you and thank you for an excellent interview.
What is needed, an increase in salary, God willing, things will get better.
It's true that we all face problems, not in wages.
Salvation according to God's will
Sure, tell me your question quickly.
Your delivery will be cut off, do you promise to ask again?
Due to high prices, the cost of all goods has increased, all of them exported.
I am from European countries.
We have factories and research centers in the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you. You've chosen your time well.
Now the issue of rising prices is an important issue.
"The condition that supports the poor, the man told you that your happiness lies in staying with the poor."
He who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some brothers we are.
Who doesn't know Qatar?
The same applies to the State of Qatar.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar? They are false.
Highest growth indicators in the world
This wealth, where does it go? And what do you do with it?
What's inside the response frame.
When the Moroccan speaks, he speaks in a way that is neither genuine nor realistic.
The person who doesn't see with his eye.
If he came and saw Qatar and how many great developments are happening there.
As we grow older, you are right, we ask less.
And every person has the right.
And being a small group, where do you get people from?
Does that really mean you'll be sourcing the increase from China, for example?
No, we will not issue, we are according to the will of God.
The state is built on a plan and upon it.
Complete dependence on oil and gas revenues, and everyone knows that oil and gas will one day run out.
that Qatar becomes
Considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Also today
Focus on
And it will have a significant impact.
After oil and gas
So, what does Dubai mimic?
Every country has its own unique characteristics.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
There will be a medical city where they come to heal.
There will be a media city that will work on adaptation.
Of course, the world today, today we must build.
Building a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal mistakes.
And there was a truth, we did not welcome this change because it took us by surprise.
As if we were not prepared for it, whether in terms of human, technical, or even educational aspects.
Now you've changed after thirty years.
And better yet
Today there is a vision.
And the vision
And the vision
Thank you, Your Excellency the Adviser, and thank you to our audience as well.
To get in touch with us and we hope we have provided you with
The policy of Qatari diplomacy appears ambiguous to many observers.
The train has a special relationship.
And at the same time, Qatar had relations with Israel and still maintains them to this day.
From the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
Qatar has submitted.
Started
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of a plot against Egypt.
The train hasn't moved far from the important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even Israeli prisoners.
Gilad Shalit, the hand of Qatari foreign policy was extended to him in a way that sparked the protest of the largest Arab states.
And what kind of power do you bring to this situation?
This achievement
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Welcome your fish, Your Honor.
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the Hijaz newspaper or magazine.
that was held with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during which communications were restored, and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was very long and required a large number of answers without your last question.
What I believe you gave him.
Especially in the Saudi marketplace
What is precise?
The Saudi queen's visit to Qatar is very important.
Between the two countries
Were you talking about the silence of Giza?
You were talking about a movement for change.
I believe these matters have been clarified from two sides.
We acknowledge the clarification.
In the State of Qatar
Conflict with Saudi Arabia
It was limited in scope.
From different perspectives
And due to the knowledge and insight of the two angels, this is by the grace of God.
King Abdullah and his lifelong friend, the Prince.
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years have passed.
She was bright, professional, and had reliable relationships.
I want to restrict the understanding between the two parties.
This file has been processed and there are no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and sincere intent among the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
It is not seasonal but strategic relationships.
We want it not to continue but to evolve.
A good diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia will withdraw its ambassador from Qatar.
I don't tend to speak diplomatically, if I did, I could probably prevent a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
So, Saudi Arabia is not diplomatic but believes.
Al Jazeera content falls under media.
Between the parties and a large number of countries intervened in the middle.
The thinking that he can gain points by taking them from other countries' accounts.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the price of Saudi Arabia.
Renegotiation within the Gulf House
I mean compared to what it was before.
Among a political agreement
No, no, there was no agreement, just an agreement on love and care.
But otherwise, you can request the Giza administration.
Have you established strategic relations between you and Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally built on a close strategy.
Do we say one, two, three, and fourth?
And it should be a union.
Some differences were settled on this basis.
Between some Arab countries and the attempt to reach a settlement of other disputes
Because now, if we look at the differences in the Arab world, all the differences lie in different points of view.
When we have an opinion on a certain policy in a certain procedure in a certain case, and another state has a different opinion.
That is viewed from two angles.
Some observers see that you are criticizing Saudi Arabia.
His criticism
Were you tired and decided to move in another direction, then moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
No, its concept is similar.
No, no, we don't enjoy this or that, we have nothing to do.
Dealing with any party in a specific manner.
I mean the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are on
There is a great understanding among them.
And you know that we created.
And it will be a kind of forms
But Saudi Arabia
I put this under two lines.
Your confrontations with Egypt started in Al-Ahram newspaper, issue 18, last April.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, he said that extended inquiries
Hezbollah's network revealed a destructive plan.
Heading to Egypt, three participating countries are Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And one of the media outlets known for its subversive role.
Qatar is the smallest country in the Arab world.
Working against Egypt.
We respect.
And its conflict over the years
I say what I say to emotionally manipulate anyone.
Complete me, I'm not done yet.
We can
President of Egypt
And who takes care
On Arab relations.
The first point
Invasive state
As they say and we read.
"That the sector"
A state of smaller size
What could be part of such schemes.
Because we have suffered from the interference of other countries in the past, and I don't want us to go back to that.
After the interference of some countries in Qatar's affairs
Hence, the policy of His Excellency's government.
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy.
What I mean is that God protects the house, and Syrians and Iranians can protect themselves, and I'm not defending them.
Stability in Egypt
Will Qatar work to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the pyramid does not produce things out of thin air.
He said that the small state of Qatar tried to fail Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
I wanted to hold a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you're using my loudspeaker called Al Jazeera Channel.
Yes, start.
With Hezbollah
And you are not pleasing Him.
But I can say that we are certain.
That we
The principle does not interfere under such circumstances.
We have forced our brothers in Egypt, and therefore we punish the Egyptian officials.
The dispute with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
By which
I'll get to that.
Days of the scent of peace and the reason for peace and us.
And it was previously celebrated in Egypt.
And after that, in the evening, we traveled.
Because Israel
We disagree with him.
No disputes with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, has sensitivity.
This is an allergy.
Why don't we sit with them?
I'll finish it.
And whenever we always wish for the best
We were discovering that this sensitivity
Or three
The conference took place in Gaza.
That Egypt does not wish to store it in Qatar.
Is not considered an Arab.
In Qatar, and there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people were under attack.
More than two weeks
But we maintain it before any prepared meeting, the Kuwait meeting where we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
And by delaying
The caliphate began.
Or a small country can
I know there are some siblings in the government, and this is considered a violation in Egypt, but it's not considered a violation by anyone else.
When they said that afterwards.
Sure, you're on the island.
The Israelis reported that a meeting will be held before any word, person, or thing to stop the conflict.
What is it?
I refused to let my brother have drugs and food during the strike that our brothers were enduring.
Once they said the door was closed.
No trucks allowed.
They tell us once that there's an agreement on the other side and they have to come.
Now is not the time we want to establish Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas, what we care about is 1.5 million and 600 thousand [people] they are hitting.
And those who do not have medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference,
Qatar's involvement in the matter affects Egypt's system.
What is intervention?
We didn't say how Egypt will solve the problem because it's their responsibility.
An official said, "We have uncovered a big plot."
He hasn't told us yet what the plan is.
The situation we're in, I mean this formality.
He tells us that Egypt is a great importance.
Sure, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
This is why we ask a great nation for so much.
Because Egypt is ours.
I invited you to a conference where they were also threatened.
We weren't invited to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We cooperated and the position was unified.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know that Turkey brought things through Israel.
I would be happy to see that coming from our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does a good political act.
We believe that this is in our interest in Qatar and in the interest of the Arab world as a whole.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If you do a good job, that's important to us.
Complete your question, and it took you a quarter of an hour to present it.
The situation now is that you've lost me, but
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now anger
I am an employee in Egypt's system.
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed at the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had a mind that wanted what it wanted.
He was eager to reach a settlement.
That's why they intervene and ban some countries from attending.
And I said this speech to our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia because we
There is no contradiction with Saudi Arabia even in this aspect.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among the elderly Muslims
A large country, where an official finds that a small country does such things.
That means you took advantage of it.
Engaging in any role
Darfur is part of Egypt's national security and Sudan's.
The five major countries decided.
Any country other than Qatar will work.
But this sensitivity will only exacerbate the situation. Why do you have to put your voice in everything that comes near you?
We want to resolve this allergy, we take an antihistamine, it should tell us what this allergy is.
Why sensitivity?
Those who belong to the government.
They want them, they suffer from internal failure.
They want to draw attention to a conspiracy in Gaza Revolution.
It's as if what is said in English punishes the Italians.
Whenever something happens
Not only for instructions but also for analytics.
We know what happened because
The case must be resolved locally.
And not analyzed
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to pay attention first to the reasons concerning my country.
Then see if I have enough time.
And to look into the reasons concerning our Arab community.
Or try the luck drop.
And if you reflect on any Arab issue in which he can contribute as much as possible
Why is it controversial? Why not take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
That came from his heart.
I'll finish it.
When he announced an initiative for unity and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we hoped for something good, and I welcome this.
Creatures decide.
Of course, the Egyptian consultant who clarified his participation.
In a report I think, or in a TV interview or something, I won't respond to him.
Because I have an answer for every point.
But to preserve the least that binds us and coordinates our Arab interests.
He also responded to the invitation mentioned by the Governor of the Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him and this other person is
And they work to correct their mistakes, whether internal or external.
In politics, economics, or anything else, as if we own our mistakes in politics and economics, so no one is considered ideal.
Because they suspect Qatar of all these claims.
Do you deny the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is an interesting topic.
Wasting Egyptian relations and distorting its role and relations with Turkey and the European Union.
While we were first a small number
If we can accomplish this role
This is not true.
There are accusations directed at you personally.
Paying the kidnapped people in Shalit so that Qatar takes Shalit and competes with Egypt in this matter.
We are always accused of paying money, firstly we didn't pay any money and we didn't talk to anyone about paying money.
But this situation
We support Egypt in its solution, as we have supported Egypt and continue to support it in solving the problem between the Palestinians.
It was he who authorized the Palestinian leader to stay until the situation was resolved.
We were there and we were the first to support the Qatari state.
In power and must finish the institutions of the Palestinians until the caliphate is established.
And We made them leaders who guide by Our command.
In the Arab Union, but he said no, we made it happen because we believe that some people don't want this.
But we made her speak intelligently.
Is he talking to his boss?
The minister is his boss.
I really don't know that there's a problem.
I don't know any of them.
They decided now in the twelfth file last April exclusively with Shorouk Newspaper.
That the political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to confront the media called Al Jazeera and the end.
This is just, just two days and everything will be over.
Are you worried that the island might become a thing of the past?
I mean, now we live in a political childhood phase?
As reported, the Emir of Qatar met with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not please them, nor did they please us.
We called out to them as brothers.
A small country making a concession to a large country like Egypt.
In Saudi Arabia, there is an important point we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we talk.
Sure, what's your opinion on the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
They rely on him heavily.
I'm speaking to you frankly.
Or is it a disagreement on fundamental policy?
I hope this isn't a personal issue because we have no personal issues. I've told you that we respect the people of Egypt.
If I asked you, you would say there are two problems: Gaza, and what next?
This situation affected all of us greatly.
We want to resolve this from a psychological perspective, i.e., resolve this conflict.
It was published in some newspapers.
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal.
We talked about everything.
But of course, things worsened and were not resolved.
No, no, he was listening, listen.
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They deny us, although it is a place for our sisters.
And we honor them as they deserve, like our little sisters.
With the great state, we do not want to compare ourselves to any great state.
I mean, Egypt is big to benefit from.
This is not a matter of life and death, but rather a matter of solutions coming from heaven.
For us if there is someone waiting for satisfaction.
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with those who are neither kin nor kind.
As a great nation, we take pride in Egypt as a great country.
But if there is a person who misleads a person
I know Israel is doing this to us.
In parallel, America's previous policy under the previous administration was either with me or against me.
So, I don't think they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Moreover, if we consider their policies, they also face pressures from third parties.
In many cases, my call to complete it.
We understand and know that even a large state has some guidelines.
What controls your policies?
We have no movement, what moves us is one thing.
An internal affair for Qatar, this is an internal affair for Qatar.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will.
What are the sources of power: Giza and Adid?
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our security is in God and our trust is in Him.
Or see his happiness, his princess
We don't want to bother anyone.
Continue, we don't want to cause any trouble for anyone.
"And it is not for us to take vengeance on every person."
They can say whatever they want, Great Qatar or not.
But we have a point of view.
First, we opened the Israel office, and then we closed it.
The first time they said to close the office, we closed it. Their problem intensified, and they went to complain to the United States. Do you believe these people?
Join the team called Devil's Team.
What they tell.
The United States and Europe are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
Secret plans
Created
This is a flaw. We reached a certain stage and then stopped.
Notify me now
Regarding the points, how will you be able to solve the problem with Egypt?
And given that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world,
We believe it's important to look at him.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is being monitored in this matter.
But some of the crew
He needs to go out.
Controlling Egyptian public opinion or government leadership or other leadership or foreign leadership
And focused on Arab interests and Egyptian equality.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead, because they are a large country.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how that would happen.
And I know there's a time for logic
And there will be a time, either for us
If it was up to me
Or among them
Significant Arab interests drew them together.
One day we will find out about this.
You mean life is still moving on?
Which means we won't respond in a similar Egyptian style to yours.
If someone gives us a hand, we give them an arm.
Now, Sir Sheikh
We were not used to continuing.
Unless it's well-founded, we're not ready to go to Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
There is a lot of misinformation surrounding Egyptian workers in Qatar and the impact of this issue on them.
There are contracts for Egyptian citizens working either in universities or at major sites.
You know that in this subject it was not our habit to attribute functions and assign tasks.
Because these people have nothing to do with anything.
This is a market where demand has changed, one is canceled and another is presented.
This is a balance between demand and supply, with an increase in some nationalities and a decrease in others.
Sure, a quick answer.
The offices were there.
We had to work late at the office, so it's best we leave now.
We used to hand it over on the days when there was a campaign. All our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So we closed it, let them fix it with Natani.
He was a guest.
And among them were those who accustomed to call all the envoys accredited in any foreign state.
So it wasn't an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't love her before. When the relationship, as they say, was good, we loved her, now it's a bit difficult.
There's no reason for you to open the office during this time.
The office will reopen when there are no other reasons left.
I became amazing.
Who made it like Egypt?
The UAE imposed this.
I want to make it clear to you that our relations with America are strategic.
In some matters, this
What is the most important thing?
There are matters in our region that are resolved in certain cases; we disagreed with the previous administration.
Now we have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is great hope in this administration.
Very interested in ensuring the stability of the situation and resolving the issue of the Palestinian people.
They are our friends, and we deny this.
What is happening in Iran, and how might it affect the Gulf and you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among them
In a usual manner, and I will ensure that they go through the factors of this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
The Gulf region is important to us, and we share borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our brothers, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
And we intervene whenever any party wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is the strategic conversation between the president.
And Lebanese groups
How to see
Yemen has no role for you, and it's not enough that they took a position.
Listen, it's known that we supported unity when most of the Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are an Arab country and a Gulf state that stood by the unity of Yemen.
From the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Emir sent me twice to meet the President of Yemen.
I explained that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the southeastern part of the Arabian continent.
And this agreement was not respected, and I do not want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me
Is it Qatar that took this position and then was accused of paying money to Houthis and senior Yemeni officials?
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
He who stands with unity does not stand against it.
Another goal of Yemen's interest, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
We don't care about that, but it was a real surprise to me.
Because I went more than ten times during the battle, His Excellency sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Undoubtedly, this is a strange accusation.
Time is up, but quickly tell me these problems that you faced due to your attempt to solve problems, will they determine your policies in intervening in other Arab problems?
If His Excellency hears me, I think there is no need.
There was a big show once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars, better than pain.
But I say this with confidence because the time in the Arab world now
It is not allowed under these circumstances.
Many thanks to you.
Perhaps even amazing with Sheikh Hammad's condition.
What happened with the Doha Agreement?
How was Doha born?
Providing the committee with guidance and full support
Discussion of Lebanon after the Israeli invasion
When there was an Arab agreement
And we went to New York, we were able to make the decision a little more smoothly.
And we discussed this in Doha that both parties were tense.
We tried our best to hear him or it won't be.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
On the ground, we know what the problem is after we've talked to the Lebanese for hours.
I believe this is a common success.
But there was a will.
I think Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere in the region is directly reflected in it.
Either peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to have this site.
Using these terms
Sorry
External results
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is one, will not be the first problem.
Sure, Sheikh, I know that the time might not be right now, perhaps it's too early to talk about the scenes, but
What happened, did you fart here?
We've kind of stopped talking about marriage on Earth now.
You weren't even a second late.
I know exactly what was happening, even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
No, from the beginning.
When I spoke with His Excellency
I told him that we're going to Lebanon.
I will present the idea that he approved and supported.
Where all Lebanese leaders are present.
Because here in Beirut you will need to go to each one of your lands.
While they are in the same hotel and in the same place.
They gathered at the same level and talked.
So we created this atmosphere, but from the start, our idea was
And that was the most important decision they had both made.
Of course
And I felt this from my role in the Arab clubs.
We must be mobile and flexible.
And thank God, I think this has shown everyone that the train made an effort.
On both sides
To achieve a mutually acceptable solution.
And there will be a solution, and there will be no loss.
Before you take a single step
The consultation took place during the Arab Union session and we found support.
What we did
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he recommended to me
For shutting down and banning their mobile phones.
We were able to get them there, and the brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that the committee cannot do anything without Arab support.
Why did they want a solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the tension that occurred
And this is the forgetting.
There is tension in Somalia, there is tension in Sudan.
Many things are happening in the world.
And every time we put out a fire.
It would be in the best interest of the Arab world to not interfere from the outside.
And we try our best.
Powers are sent.
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point for discussion.
He always used to say that the solution to the Lebanon file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab tour.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to a fundamental change between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
Needs a self-review in the Arab world.
Because of Arab differences.
And any agreement between other Arab states
And we tried this.
In the Thirty-Seven War
When Arabs agree on a solution to a problem.
I think this is beneficial.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties must work together.
Overcome wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we here in the Arab world face many great challenges.
All the people are playing in our playground's garden.
You are neither here nor there.
And how do we stop this theater in the space of the Arab countries?
Arabs at least the minimum of agreement
Undoubtedly, we comment on that.
As we watch
Our differences as Arabs and the lack of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
Arab countries
It's not betrayal, but rather a type of...
Revulsion is what word?
This is a case that needs support from everyone, I mean, I think.
Sure, will this desire work and require an Arab meeting?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
Butting into the conversation
So is it possible for us to take a role in resolving the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if?
Eager to find solutions and I will ensure they possess the wisdom.
They might reach an agreement.
Among them in many cases
And there was balance in politics, and I will ensure that with God's will this continues.
That relations have improved.
Both parties need to move.
But I can't be sure that's what's happening now.
I am sure that Arabs, if they focus on resolving the differences between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab states that I mentioned earlier,
Optimism and a sense of pride among citizens that there is a broad Arab call.
But I can't say what happened in Lebanon.
It can be interpreted on the ground that there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be US-Iranian tension, or perhaps other situations.
Will there be concerns about that in the coming months?
We are Muslims.
We cannot deliver only food and medicine.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and always at his service.
More than one and a half million Palestinians live under siege.
"And we are not those who would compromise them with peace or support."
They do all this.
And no electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to be delivered to the Palestinians.
And to the rest of the Palestinians, we only send food and medicine.
And our disagreement with them could continue.
And I want the Palestinians on both sides to put the national interest first.
And leave the false appearances.
The current Palestinian dispute is a deep wound.
Finding a solution
But they didn't commit
This is a serious matter, they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
They should ask until they return to Mecca and the Queen of Saudi Arabia.
Resolve this dispute.
They are of no use.
And any covenants from any party
I want there to be a solution, but
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties that we
We will not be a part of it, nor do we accept being a part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with him.
But we are an independent country and they are an independent country.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests won't harm them now or ever.
We believe that the fate of the Gulf should be agreed upon with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Iran's cooperation and peaceful relations with its neighbors.
But when you say that a sector is not part of
Any details or clarifications
Simply a sign.
No, Never
Sure, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if it's allowed.
Frankly, Your Honor, we are facing a big obstacle, but we have reached a solution in the last few hours.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
The information might be disparate and unrelated, but what happened was...
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, I know it if there was a specific date before that.
So you knew there were negotiations.
Continuous search for a solution
Undoubtedly, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And changed the policy of negotiations.
These negotiations led to
Leading to a positive outcome, we gathered some parties from different directions.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this article.
Tell me what is missing from this paper.
And we started talking about each subject one by one.
At the last moment, he overcame an obstacle and continued to the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And removed this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We listened to a speech by the Emir of the State of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
Don't think about your role now.
Listen, the most important thing is to stay out of the spotlight.
He has no territorial ambitions.
Or even that we control another state or something because our state
Our sizes... We take pride in ourselves, and believe that we can contribute to solving problems with our other friends.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
We have countries that are
We want them to do something, and that's important.
Some small countries are allowed to take on this role and are supported.
Excellent in some things, good in some things, and less than good in some things.
The last question, sir.
What is a central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Safety or dispute resolution
Confront Israel.
We stop the match at the Arab Stadium.
We analyze our problems in the Arab countries.
Choosing an active member in Iraq
To dedicate things.
Nationally and locally
But if we were praying.
Or he will live in hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
International initiatives to stop the ongoing war on Gaza.
We start by requesting a meeting with the Arab Federation Council at the ministerial level.
It's as if you've changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Kind, I hope, my brothers, Hassan, to be in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Facing our brothers in Gaza
Conditions oblige us to do a lot.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
Realistically, when we adopted the idea of the Arab summit before
Not only Security Council resolutions but also through
He is neither underestimated nor taken lightly.
I'm saying it in another way.
He is punishing us.
That the street can't bear it anymore, if we act as officials responsible for an Arab street.
It is unlikely that it will be allowed.
When we were in Egypt
There were ten to eleven written consent documents.
Someone spoke at the meeting, and we might have a meeting.
The feeling of the remoteness of Arab unity.
And I don't punish them if they have an opinion in a meeting.
And how is the problem solved?
Because he's moving.
This important topic
Because our goal is not promotion or advertising, but our goal is to find.
So the summit wasn't ignored.
We ask ourselves even.
We will turn to put pressure on the poor other side.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's stick to the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
He made it clear that the situation may call for an Arab summit with whoever attends it.
We found that most of our brothers support holding the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I don't know what is meant by balance?
We are the only side of the peoples.
Only the Arab people, if you go to any country in Asia or Latin America.
Unsolved
Classified as moderate countries
And what is balance in our eyes?
Will he withdraw from the Palestinian cause?
Simply because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in any way?
No country allows interference, whether good or bad.
Like Hezbollah, and perhaps another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
Can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if it was intended for us to engage in an internal Arab conflict.
Sure, if we move to the security department.
There is no consensus in the Security Council.
I hope Israel finishes its mission.
Sure, the second meeting of the Arab ministers that I was invited to attend.
which was dominated by intense discussions, disagreements, and conflicts
There is an important point.
This is not what matters.
When we request a meeting
Around the corridors
There is no certain peace.
Are the ministry ready for that?
Because there's a party telling you we need to wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
And the negotiations for peace with Israel.
We say that we are in a party that says we will lose in this.
There is a greater loss than the one we have incurred now, but we have always been honorable, respectful, and adhered to decisions since the days of the truce.
She says that conflicts are not important.
There was someone who wondered if it would be possible to destroy Hamas and something similar.
This reflects a political stance more than it does tension between two ministers.
Undoubtedly, this happened.
But not all people
He doesn't want her to talk about anyone else.
It is important that we are men of our families and men of our nation.
We make the policies of our countries.
Who does that anymore?
I think
I don't think they'll accommodate us in the end.
Is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone, and I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What will his schedule do?
The situation began with the decision of the Arabs' efforts.
The question here is whether Israel will implement the resolution immediately.
We can say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I know for a certainty that there are difficulties.
"It is not asked by the international community, and even if asked, it wouldn't matter."
He will be interested.
The state
They emphasized that they had done something for the Jews and Israelis.
Preserving their rights
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs do not go to the Security Council
Reaching the top and making tough decisions
And the Western countries will try to influence us.
Because we are in the heart of the Arab world and there are many of us, you can see how the Arab street interacts with this.
But this decision is important.
Due to the issuance of a summons to our leaders one after another.
In the end, they said it was nothing, which was a lie.
Sure, if we were like Germany now, what would we ask for?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they initiated the attack, just say you have incorrect information.
and the extermination of hundreds of thousands
Because you are a weak Arab party.
We were as one, as Arabs.
Worked hard in his way.
Offered
As if it were a stroke of luck and an act of God.
If the Arab nation says you are sending troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur.
Arabic is considered, or there are those who consider it, a decision of one thousand six hundred and sixty.
And our friends worked hard to save the decision.
Issued by the Security Council
I don't want to say whether it was a win or not.
And what leads to
Let's assume that winning
What we'll do
We're supposed to disagree with the other decisions.
But I assure you that we will cooperate with the decision.
Undoubtedly, you will get the decision, although you shouldn't do that.
Even after Israel's rejection, Israel came and agreed.
This means that we
Should you get a replacement or is it better to call for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think Arab race
At the same time, ready for any alternative.
And I believe that the Arab people have enough to join.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To incite one class against another in Palestine instead of reaching an understanding between them.
We start trying to make plans.
As soon as they held a meeting, I don't know if it was a collaboration between Europeans or Arabs or something like that without mentioning names.
And after they did, I mean that we participate.
In the app
What is asked of us from the West.
But if we're going
I want there to be order in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The sequels because this issue in Gaza started two years ago, not now.
I will talk about the subject two years ago but as regards the decision, precisely.
Do you have measures for his conditions?
Issued but not implemented.
We weren't invited.
Perhaps they think we have a different perspective.
Everyone was expected to have a coherent opinion.
Not everyone has to agree, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
What is happening in Gaza has been going on for two years, and the number of parties has decreased.
One team gained control over another team involved in the siege of Gaza.
Do you really agree with what he said, or what he implied, or what he criticized from here or there?
For genuine Arab cooperation in light of what is happening in Gaza now.
We are partially informed.
It's important to tell you that we weren't fully mobilized.
But I know.
Palestinian rift
He was fed at the Arab and international levels.
And if he had been an oppressor, they would not have scattered as they did.
And after the elections...
Hamas came and took control.
By a majority
We should have given them a chance and seen.
Do they want reform, or are they still discouraged, knowing only weapons and fighting?
But the day they came
On the Arab level, I believe that some of our brothers thought that these extremist movements should not come to power.
Some say there's an attack happening now.
Made by the Hamas whose ceasefire has ended, or by the Palestinians from Gaza whose ceasefire has ended.
Calmness
The remnants while the Palestinian people in Gaza suffer from hunger for two years.
This is acceptable.
For reasons of Israel's security
It's clear that we don't want them in power, but that doesn't matter to me in Qatar.
But what's wrong with other people?
And then who decides?
That neither of these, every country does not own the victory of its choice.
Our government
It is the fundamental problem.
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If we were working hard, we were working hard to exacerbate the disagreement.
But it's clear that we were asked to allow one team to outperform the other because this team...
We consider them armed or we consider them.
Everything that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party to give them a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
We return to the efforts of the world and the Arab world to stop what is happening, according to what you said you were saying.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
They are the Egyptian Initiative, the Initiative.
And the Egyptian in Cairo.
Those are the works of the Egyptians.
There aren't any. It's not avoidance.
This is required for an important role.
In parallel, Egypt's borders are adjacent to Israel and Palestine.
What we are
And that we will not stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, and we are calling on people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
Must be
And then we always ask them for a big role.
What was announced.
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to provide the possibility of success or study.
I think the likelihood of his success
If the siblings are in Egypt.
Make Palestinian viewpoints more similar.
And it is the influential party in Gaza that should discuss the initiative.
Because who can say yes or no?
It's an important point.
When Resolution 1860 was adopted
This is an Arab Palestinian problem that we own.
We don't want to hear any sides.
But I really wanted it, when the Palestinian delegation went.
And when they went to the tournament, they asked that someone from Gaza be sent with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We don't allow authority.
To be our own goal, and not build our policy.
Staying in place
The sheikh now.
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative because you haven't gone through its materials.
Do you think that in principle, this could be an appropriate mechanism to implement the international community's Resolution 1860 as some people have claimed?
Parallel name
Now, not tomorrow or the day after because
Passes every day
There will be a murder of our brother over there.
That's why we don't want to delay this matter, and the Israelis don't want to delay it either. When they finish their work, we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are paying attention to it.
I want to clarify everything you said.
Now we must solve this problem.
And not the way Israel shows it.
Turkey's role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it work?
Arab conqueror
Undoubtedly, a very distinguished position.
And he has an Arabic depth.
Entrance for disabled Arabs
We know there is an Arab disability.
Part of the reason was due to disagreements.
Part of it is due to perspective; everyone thinks their perspective is the best.
Another person believes that his viewpoint is better.
"Otherwise, there was awareness, how did they allow the Jews to respect and recognize that there was an Arab settlement?"
Or they will follow us one by one.
Another says: No, this is acceptable. We'll give them an extra two or three days, so we can contact them, bring in friends to even the numbers, and solve the problem.
We need to rise above this and not accept it.
Hamás may contain errors, but we will deal with them.
At the Arab level
But now
At least we tell them no.
In the context of the required stance from a sector, stances such as, "We will revisit this position later on," but
Also in the field at the same time I heard
Yesterday, Khaled Meshaal, the head of the political bureau of the Palestinian movement Hamas, was in Beirut.
First, it is not necessary for me to listen to everything that Brother Khalid Michel said, with all due respect and appreciation.
Why don't we sit with Michel Khaled and talk to him as Arabs?
We go to him in the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing conditions, Israel also imposes conditions.
Let them impose conditions, haven't they been allowed to impose conditions while Israel can?
First, what do you think of these Arab gifts?
Cows and chickens, and not once do we listen to the people of this country tell me that de Gaulle didn't listen.
Completely different, first of all, de Gaulle won his country's freedom.
With or without partners, he liberated his country from hot occupation.
Now what we're talking about
Is this an assumed Arab gift?
The president must represent the opinion of his people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we've seen.
Who can these classes cater to?
As many of those criticizing Qatar in this case demand
About what is happening with the actor and the facility is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
To cut ties, all connections, even if someone says they have an agreement.
They simply want Qatar to be isolated.
What we are
It is more important than the relationship.
This decision is not limited to this one or to even more difficult decisions.
Better than this decision.
This means that we need a unified Arab stance.
For those who are distinguished.
No one should be sold to another for moral or material gains, or so it's called.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are countries that have also taken individual steps.
The good hawker is a different matter, it differs with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five permanent ambassadors and presenting evidence, these are films.
That we're done and that the street knows better now.
Due to the high ceiling, my lord the sheikh.
Or asked the Lebanese forces to confront the Israeli threat and otherwise
Do you think it could have succeeded if it had been integrated into a single Arab framework?
But we call for an Arab platform that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
Or that we encourage
How do Syria, Libya, and other countries present themselves when there are Arab countries that don't communicate with each other?
Must be
A shift in Arab relations.
This is the current policy among Arab states now.
It's still there, but I think it's already expired.
In goals
The important issue
And we know the structure of the Lebanese building.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
He gave an example if her lands were returned.
The situation in Gaza will escalate, they are still there.
Encompassing all directions
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the goals for Israel, any operational goals for Israel.
On one day it strikes a person, on another day it punishes a person, and on another day it pleases a person.
For example, what happened in Lebanon to them is not a good example.
The sample analyzed that remained in Lebanon
That is considered good.
For war
Listen to the problem of Gaza or Palestine, for the solution there is easier than the solution in Lebanon.
Those who differ among themselves, should we return to our land today or tomorrow?
Misunderstood about strength
In the distribution of power
It spreads because they are closer to each other in terms of thinking.
Better than the Lebanese thinker.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And here's the problem
Your emptiness, Sheikh.
It means we only have a few minutes if we wrap this up.
And the negotiations.
How does this process end?
I am a Palestinian from Gaza.
I'm telling you
Or refuse
And it helps.
What didn't fit us.
There will be an Arab failure.
In strategic terms
But from the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't observe a full initiative.
Neither before nor now, why?
The problem is not one of innovation as we feel.
Whoever solves the problem, we will assist without mentioning Qatar's name because some people face issues with mentioning Qatar.
We are not organizing a summit because there is already a summit scheduled for March.
If we start an initiative, we'll be better than our brother. I don't think so.
"And do not impose on them a pressure."
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
We are taking this initiative, and we have seen all parties that held a meeting on the fourth day and was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, with God's pleasure, to make progress, and we hope that our Arab brothers will assist us to the utmost in this file.
And our hope is to distance him from the competition.
Arab competition
Due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at the time.
And these are our problems, okay, we fight among ourselves and disagree.
I don't want to go through this.
In Kuwait next month, I think of course the state of the Arabs.
As you know, as you have indicated and clarified.
Is it the whole Arab atmosphere, assistance, is it the first economic summit?
His generous uncle
And also, any summit held in another country, we participate in.
And I don't care about attending any summit.
But there are no fears that he will become a political leader.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
It's too late even if it's in ten days.
Do you talk about the Palestinians after beating them for 25 days?
Will be
Don't they say that the Arabs never met?
We said that we
We said that we
With all due respect, this summit has been planned, and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In our own way, we are disappointed.
And from it.
And you get peace.
And I say that's all there is to it, guaranteed.
For this reason
Thank you to the audience for watching.
The ongoing coverage of the war on Gaza continues. Congratulations.
A few days ago, I held a festival for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a special bill
She was also a member of several local and Arab bodies in the field of childhood.
Provided more than fifty-seven lectures, workshops, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
First, let's agree on the term currently used.
What do we say to people with disabilities, do we say "special needs" or as you said "people with disabilities"?
The first hello of the evening.
Used from a cultural or human rights perspective because people with disabilities
Because it addressed people with disabilities as people first.
Human
And then it ended after after after after after after after after after after after.
The medical concept was dominant at that time.
Heading towards the concept
Education and special education emerged.
This category has become
That's why we started calling them people with special needs.
From which the standard rules are derived.
The special monitor's task is to oversee the implementation of this document.
It rapidly expanded until the appearance of the international agreement, which was legally binding and clarified through rules in this regard.
And he set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
Dealing with these people as if they were humans, as if they were persons.
Once the terms are changed as you mentioned, is there a shift in the concept of this group within society?
Yes, it moves in a certain style.
This varies from region to region.
But the distinctive thing about this
The distinctive or distinguished Arab world
But the directions of the law include human rights, and work, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably a lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, that's what I wanted to say: culture exists, but there is sometimes a lack of resources and a lack of political will.
Sometimes laws though
But unfortunately, awareness is also low, and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
80 to 90 percent of people with disabilities are from developed countries and of working age.
And suffers from unemployment
I mean during my oiling of the Darfur.
Or with the existence of warehouses and weapons
Males are one degree better.
Add disabilities, they will live in remote and distant areas.
That's why there are many entities working in this field and trying to develop it.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Since we're establishing many religious centers, let's talk instead.
They were sent to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
This is one of the things that we are grateful for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current arrangement of Qatar.
To develop an agenda
Or incorporate the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to include these centers.
Under the deterioration in the condition of people with disabilities in the world
I can't say that, and I agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a decline in the Arab region due to the state of disabilities.
Placed within the social context within the political and economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be
While they are among the marginalized groups
In a country like I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the other hand, I cannot absolutely confirm that the situation has not improved.
And it was really applied on the ground, and if I can give an example, I would say
Qatari red deer
We agreed that projects include
People with disabilities and health issues are included in this strategy, and other programs also operate.
What we also tried to include
In the activities of institutions on the ground
Kamel Karrou is with us now from Syria, hello.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kirro.
Solomon Kierro forgive me go Solomon
Welcome, and welcome to Lady Hafsa.
First: Are there intellectual barriers within the laws of the United Nations?
Mental disability means that a healthy person became a result of what turned into a stressor leading to mental impairment.
His son's disability resulted from torture and imprisonment, causing mental impairment. He remains under treatment to this day, which has been ongoing for two years.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and those with disabilities, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
Realistically, I
Because they know, as they teach their children.
And all the meaning without making themselves.
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people...
Some of them distort or disobey the wisdom of Islam, and do not derive anything from it.
Thank you very much, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
We return to our guest to teach him about
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was a mental defect or not.
Yes, it falls between the global rankings.
Of course, disabilities, mental and developmental disabilities as they are called.
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities such as visual or hearing impairments.
Of course, as mentioned, disabilities are
Interaction and response that occurs within a social context.
In the Arab world or any other regions
Certainly, addressing disabilities took a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a Special Representative, one of the things I sought to address and accomplish was...
In other words, the right of every person.
Until they provide them with
And various qualifying dimensions to ensure their entry into schools as well as organized work.
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, there is in this international committee.
Me too, I mean as a special representative.
My truth is in my work, and this has been positive for me even if it's not directly related.
Who supported this position?
I have seen him at many meetings, for example, the international conference.
Rights of persons with disabilities
Handicapped by these restrictions or these defects
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disabilities.
The United Nations took some time to prepare and write.
For organizations and entities
For example, and I'll conclude with that.
Global governments and non-governmental organizations are members in the United States.
We answered another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To realize the extent to which there are programs for people with disabilities in their schedule.
If budgets are allocated, and if there is involvement of people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues.
We're taking more calls, we have with us now Michri Naji from Algeria, hello Naji.
You too
I wanted to ask my sister who should be punished for the mistake.
I wanted to ask, I've had a physical disability from the start.
Sure, we'll address this question with Naji Mishri from Algeria, thank you very much, Ahmed.
Hello, Halabi from Greece.
Good evening, Sir, good evening to the guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, even hosting them in seasonal tourism, this is what happens in Europe.
Is someone with a mental disorder considered disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
Everything we're discussing falls within the realm of unproductive debate, thank you.
Sister Hisa pointed out the insufficiency of financial resources.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand
Launch an international fund to support disabilities and allocate one percent of net profit to each global organization.
It should be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
Many disabled people, war victims, and the like will compete on inability.
Thank you very much, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mishri was wondering and mentioned his problem that he is disabled.
At the local or national level, that is, through Algeria
The needs of the community must be met within this community.
Are they the same rights given to anyone else?
In other words, the right to live first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I call from here, from this podium, governments, especially Arab governments.
For the benefit of the resident and the individual
Guarantee
Needs and rights within current programs
No, there's no need to make new gadgets.
To meet the needs of the injured person or not to if the state.
Can, and they are already obligated to implement it.
I recommend first that he returns and refers back to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it is within my national scope and should be within this range.
What the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities mentioned, but there are a large number of countries that signed it but did not abide by it.
And here's a question from a listener, why are there no laws?
It is a certain fact that we are in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and numerous truths.
Certainly, many principles and agreements do not demonstrate a material commitment.
Or an ideal commitment for many countries that have joined many of these, such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and infringements, and we know that
But the question of adopting an agreement and organizing it.
First, we will ensure that there is at least awareness.
This awareness starts from the top in this triangle with the decision-makers.
Officials, then gradually grow until they reach the entire society.
As regards our commitment to prepare reports and submit them to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and higher consciousness
To the reports that I worked as a representative at the United Nations
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
So there is a comparative advantage to agreeing on the rights of people with disabilities.
So, I advise, I urge, and I call upon.
It is also important that people with disabilities are given
And he will hear what Ali Abbadi Al-Saniri, the president of the Qatar Association for the Hearing Impaired and Proficient, will say to us.
Mr. Naji Saghrin will speak about that, welcome Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
I am with Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Senara, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Center for Culture and Society for the Hearing Impaired in Qatar.
It is managed by Lady Hisa.
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As a person who has been on a train
And the chair of the council, in fact, was a lady named Hesa who had a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is, in fact,
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world
Especially the Arab world.
And I want to be deaf.
For this international agreement to be implemented in these countries.
This will help people with special needs, and it should be mandatory.
Frankly, for this contract to be enforceable in all countries
Abuod Alseniri, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing
Let's stop.
Here, we continue our discussion after a short break. Stay tuned.
Share your opinions on important issues in the economic, political, sports, and other fields.
Five-star service through Giza Life.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back with today's guest, Ms. Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability is an international fund for support.
Disabilities and the obligation for all countries to provide funding - what do you think of this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
And without happiness, contributions are very weak.
The task of monitoring the implementation of legal rules
After working for two years, I didn't get any useful support.
Concerning China and Germany only
I always mean to thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the state is me, Qatar.
The office, through which many activities and projects were implemented, was established, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates that
I mean like what was raised initially and this point has always been raised.
Terms of Ordinary People
So, what is the term for taking care of people with disabilities or caring for the disabled?
This means there is a real, genuine, and true synchronization.
In all circumstances, in all categories
People with disabilities, migrant children and women, refugees
All this will lead us to a level called, for example,
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And they are these voices that always demand and never tire or give up.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't we allocate a part, sorry.
For the purposes of these programs and projects
As he has already mentioned, and I truly thank him for this.
Islamic Development Bank
From the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what I informed you about in paying financial obligations.
Do the resources provided to assist people with disabilities only include developing countries and Arab states?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person who was before me, who is the Swede, yes.
Including some EU countries.
Certainly, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that may not have
I am aware of the existence of this special representative.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
And the Arab region, unfortunately, there were many commitments, but unfortunately there was only one state.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have the most calls with Hamad Al-Marri from Hamad Train. Hello!
Peace be upon you
And upon you too.
Hello, Dr. Saha.
Approximately ten
We noticed that this girl has a psychological defect.
What's your role in a girl going through such suffering?
With her colleagues
I mean, sometimes even if we preserve
What is your role towards the children of a Qatari girl?
Thank you very much, Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, arguing from Kuwait, hello.
As they say, Sheikh Hissa.
Why don't we leave our fuel in its dark storage?
Those who need customization, we can enumerate them.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can dismantle the psychological barriers between us and them.
By reactivating individual morale
And benefit him in a great cause.
If we truly believe
Thank you, Ms. Haisa, for all your efforts and everything you have done during your tenure as Special Representative.
Out of her grace and appreciation, and thank the State of Qatar for all it has done for those with special needs.
Many thanks Aisha Muhannad from Qatar
Peace be upon you, Dr. Wasila.
Peace be upon you, dear friends.
And to your noble guest
I serve Sheikh Hessa.
I'll ask a question about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disabilities, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level may be the result of families in which marriages between relatives are conducted.
I think the proportion is large.
Leading to disabilities
Many thanks to our noble guest from Tunisia, I now return to our guest.
The first to call was Hamad Al-Marri, he was wondering.
Where does a mentally disabled girl go?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
Certainly, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are psychological disabilities like those mentioned or any other psychological disabilities
For schools
Before that was
Oh no, I mean private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The noble and revered leader from Tunisia pointed to something very important.
Scientific research and similar copies
From programs of organizations that work on disabilities only, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All these matters led to the development of numerous campaigns and programs related to reproductive health.
I was talking about this aspect.
Implementing health strategies
Under consciousness
To demonstrate the risks of consanguineous marriage
and genetic factors
I believe it has been implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but it certainly takes time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, the interaction will shift to him, but it's essential that there's a legal duty in terms of
Yes, Caravan, in a plea, asked and proposed to allocate one percent of the budget of Arab states.
To help those with disabilities, let me start first.
Yes, there are statistical estimates carried out by the World Health Organization at the global level as a whole.
There are four or forty million people with disabilities.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are increasing.
As in a study in South Africa where they saw and documented.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, three people become injured.
And since the Arab region has become a region of continuous collisions
Even Caravan's proposal in argument.
One percent is enough.
Assisting people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of representation for people with disabilities or other marginalized consumer groups
Frankly and honestly, I don't think it fits.
Addressing their issues and needs.
It was confirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Conducted by governments and not usually considered disabled.
That's right, and that's why it is sometimes linked to the culture and constraints of society.
When the census is conducted by
Competent Authorities
That there is an injured person in the house.
The only question was whether there was someone defective or not.
The relevant department and the authorized personnel in this regard.
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend more details.
First, indicate the gender of the affected person, whether male or female.
Will I receive help or not?
In fact, even if the figures are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
As attention and care should be advanced, Fatima Al-Dossari is with us from Qatar, welcome Fatima.
And peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with a chronic disability.
And I thank His Highness, the ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his sister, Sheikh Moza, for joining this department.
I am very excited to receive this recognition and attention.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Mussafri Hello
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
Many thanks to Lateefa Almseefri from Qatar who is with us now, Nasim.
Abu Kareem from Jordan, hello Naseem
Just go, we hear you.
Peace be upon you too.
God bless you, I must say I have an intervention.
First of all, I am an audio expert and I worked in the State of Qatar for about four years.
We had a month-long awareness campaign about hearing and speech impairments.
We organized conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns for hearing impairments.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, I lived there for almost three years.
Frankly, it offers new and beautiful services.
Frankly, you provide new services, whether they are material, non-material, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our own activities as well.
They get good support.
Sure, do you have a direct question? Because due to time constraints, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, the services are excellent, and I believe they are excellent at the moment.
Can you address the viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Relevant to the subject.
I will also return to the issue of agreement.
That is immediately bound after its affirmations and accession.
As one of the duties of the state or these institutions
Because it depends on this issue of people's rights, regardless of
And from the truthful perspective, what
What is done during that period for infected people and the reason for it.
And you want that to happen now.
Of course, I wish if it was
I hope that this can be measured in this study or survey, and provide higher-quality research in this field.
As it turned out to me from this experience.
Two years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have roles, not just rights, they get rights.
Sheikh Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, formerly the UN Special Representative on Disability, thank you.
We now have the presenter from the roles and cups channels, Lana online, good morning Lana.
I am also happy to welcome the bright pioneer in the Um Salama clan, Pioneer Ali Kasim.
Hello, Ali.
Hello %pw
I named you with patience.
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Everyone can congratulate openly. Lana, please.
My exhibition was open for five hours yesterday and two hours the day before.
I congratulate Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens, they deserve this international achievement.
I might have a chance to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his son, Prince Tamim.
Yes, of course, Lana. You are in the field of sports and one of the experts in this area, highly specialized in these lines and the field.
Because our file is still
And a competitor, meaning we deserve the six-point difference in votes between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
That was because our file was rich and comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors, and well supported, for example, the fields.
Perhaps some people were afraid, perhaps there were some %pw, like in the United States.
Some countries may be ready, not needing to provide venues, but rather preparing special projects for this event.
Because they're already prepared.
But they were tense about this aspect.
Captain Ali, as heroes, I think this is a very significant achievement for heroes.
It will affect the economic, political, and health sectors, I suppose.
But, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course, this is a great achievement especially for us, I even saw how happy the non-playing players were.
God willing, Ali, tell me about the moment the winner is announced.
I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio channel.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
While I was driving and listening to the radio
The moment Qatar and...
We were both screaming, and of course the window overlooking the roof was open.
So my friend entered his body from the car's roof.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we turned off the lights and started our entertainment alone.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Thank God, it was a very special day, I think all the channels focused heavily on this event.
Lana, of course I was involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How do they celebrate this event and what was their behavior like?
There were many media and channels from all over the world.
It became a distinctive meeting place, clear on the map, Qatar became famous.
Certainly, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I assume it's a responsibility you'll take seriously.
What's your opinion on that point in particular?
Without Ali, do they clarify the required traits to join the league?
Now there are more expected sports events.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
That has strong foundations and well-prepared plans in the ball game.
So, what are the rules and principles that the player should be distinguished by?
I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Rigorous, continuous training and discipline
All these are basic things that help direct all his effort in matches or training sessions.
I believe that every stage has a distinctive quality.
It has a unique taste and puff.
Talk shows and sports programs, which one do you prefer, where are you located?
Excellent
Helps you maintain your body's health and learn how to keep yourself healthy through exercise, which is the important part.
Just as everyone watches football matches, you'll automatically love it when you enter the stadium.
Are people who work in the media restricted to one side?
Doesn't it restrict you in any way?
This is an open field, not limited to football.
This is all exercise, but exercise is excellent.
Ali, therefore, there are some other important issues that I would like to discuss.
Why didn't you want to go back ten years in age until you reached 2022?
Yes, unless you want to
Of course, players now dream of this tournament especially since it's the World Cup, now any player
Anyone who watches World Cup matches will be happy, what if he were playing in the World Cup?
I hope they meet the expectations and it's an opportunity for them.
What do you want to say as a professional player? Captain, what do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love to be with you.
As I said, I'm currently on vacation, but
His return to the league after a 12-year absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
I wanted a beautiful note from the Qatar Channel and distinctive memories.
God willing, Qatar's channel will become like a university that graduates a large number of media personnel.
Our game is daring and we hope to win many different awards.
Let's discuss an important point regarding the Dynasty team.
How are you there, how are you, I hope you are well.
Of course, thank God, frankly
Of course, yesterday, in the studio, we talked about many players.
So, I think some of the young men who were watching us think that you...
Required
This is very common in my Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I had a good shot in Um Salala, *as a show*.
I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, thank God.
My situation with the team is very good.
How can we make sports a social issue?
And if Qatar is excluded, how can we engage women, children, and youth in sports?
Everything is connected, everything complements sport.
Women play a role in all sports skills.
And expanding, every individual, whether small or integrated into this community, realizes the importance of sport.
For nineteen or twenty years, until we reach this event, is enough.
We have newer generations.
The generation grows up, but we must raise a generation aware of sports from an early age.
We get Aspir, Aspir is an effective structure.
It is essential for the new generation to engage in sports.
We just need to be specific and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the various club competition games?
Frankly, the lack of attendance is an issue we face in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association still hasn't found a way to attract the public.
What methods do we use to attract them to attend football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending school.
Materiality plays a fundamental role, on the one hand, in avoiding public scrutiny.
And now they use a ticket or points system here.
No, no, the football association has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs use methods to attract the audience like Rayan, but Rayan Club is famous and does not need to attract the audience.
Some clubs organize pw, and some administrative departments organize activities and events.
For the viewers, to encourage them, I think this is the only way.
The players, I mean the new generation.
To love what they do and rely on their capabilities, as you said, is not enough with financial support, they need more moral support.
Thank you very much for this wonderful interview, God willing.
So, we want to hear your final opinion on Qatar's qualification to host the 2022 World Cup, Lana, please.
I would like to affirm that the State of Qatar always supports, and
Since you want to translate the text into Qatari Arabic, this is what it translates to: بما أنك ترغب
My wishes for success, and I hope you continue to succeed.
Thank you, Captain Ali, for your leadership and dedication. I wish you all the best in your athletic pursuits and in life. May God bless you.
I love sports even more.
The event will focus on young talents.
Some young people say that these songs are popular now, but they have a deep and great history.
A group of young people are singing words in Arabic or English.
Today we'll talk about this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We will get to know them better through the direct interview that brings us together.
Welcome to our series, dear visitors, no matter where you are.
For years, a new type of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf fields.
From the West, particularly America, there is rap.
Before we start talking about rapping,
There is courage in using any word without hesitation.
Anyone can rap.
Regarding songwriting,
Most rappers write their own lyrics.
So, we will get to know all these numerous and important details from two people who have worked hard in this field.
Their performance was good.
Yousef Al-Nuaimi and Salem Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Welcome, good morning Salman.
Hello, welcome.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
It's natural that the path of rap singers is thorny.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We conclude that Rap did not exist in Qatar.
Better.
In the interest of the citizen.
Including jokes, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these songs, I think they are like an artist painting a picture and a poet working on writing poetry.
A composer can play any instrument, and a voice can sing.
Do you think there is acceptance in Qatari society, in Gulf society, for this type of songs?
One thousand twenty.
Do you feel that people love buying rap CDs?
Different ages
There are families and dozens of people who are hearing more than before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are on this band so far?
This means you can all say words, write poetry, and perform in a rap style.
You could also say that the one who sings is the teacher.
It's him who sometimes plays, writes the words,
Oh, okay!
I'm asking to listen, and I tell him that I recorded this song.
Undoubtedly, all these songs that you've produced are from Salman, from Yusuf, from anyone in the same team.
Did you consider putting it on cassette and making it available in stores?
But you know, if someone is lonely, it means I'll make the album and put it on the market, so it's difficult with commercial recording and procedures.
Stop, why are you thinking like that? You're 25 years old and you're not exporting anything yet.
There will be two of them, if God wills, your hand will be twenty-five, God will protect each of you, as young men and brothers.
Discs are produced and created through multiple websites.
Facebook, YouTube, and our local newspapers expand.
I think he has thirteen songs.
The record was not like this.
This is a bit old, but it's clear.
It has poor quality, it wasn't like this before, but it's clear.
He produced about fifty albums.
There is rap, I can't say there wasn't, because there were young people who practiced this art ten years ago.
It's not as strong as the record, and I hope it's distributed during this period, now it's different.
Especially since there is diversity in music, and a wide variety of techno music nowadays.
Those who produce a collection of wonderful songs.
As we also want to talk about the festivals you have participated in.
Look, the side I participated with in Doha is one.
He was signed by Al Sadd Club, and they were very cooperative.
We look to ensure the viewing audience.
We were surprised; we didn't expect such a large number.
We were also surprised that more families participated in attending.
More than the youth
The organization was amazing.
We were nervous because it was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect such attendance.
Interaction with the audience was excellent.
It took a long time, so there were many songs.
Sure, let's hear something, or words they've created, from the audience, especially the young ones like them.
Let's listen to some songs so we can perform them for the audience.
Can we hear him live?
Take your time.
Go safely.
The thing is, it's random.
Listen together.
I don't know.
We talk in the lounge of the swimmer's paradise.
One likes to go to the program in the morning.
Salem is an expert; this is the fifth year he's been doing rap.
Even if people don't like it.
They know nothing about it.
The words are random.
Sure, the songs you've presented, give me some of the songs you've written before.
See, not all songs are random, or what people call "free rhythm" in English.
They are on the same wavelength.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Eldoa program.
We are shown on television, for the public.
Let's see what one plus one plus one adds up to.
Together from dawn till dusk.
The beautiful nostalgia I heard exactly.
I insisted on distributing them everywhere and online.
I really appreciate you, when will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone makes themselves.
He won't find himself executing that easily.
So everyone writes.
Of course, I suppose that every artist, whether a writer or a poet, is always...
He can also write for the love of sports.
Or love of country
And I'm sure you participated in our national day.
Through beautiful songs, they represent the youth of Qatar.
A Doha glow is expected to welcome the Asian Cup, and gatherings will be held on the Corniche.
To revive this event
We're sending this video live.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's see it together through these live images.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
Let's go back to our guests Youssef and Salem, and be happy to have them with us.
They are from an Arab Gulf rap team, am I right?
Can we call it that way?
Now, frankly, we
Preparing a party, but not confirmed yet.
But, you are working on a party that, God willing, Jesus will announce.
If God wills, but it hasn't been proven yet, we're still at the beginning.
You are still at the beginning of your career. I wish you all the best, and rest assured that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Like Salman, where do you all meet, each of you, twenty people?
Where do you meet, and how do you gather all the ideas?
Certainly, there are some shared songs.
No one has to sing like Salman, Issam, or any of you a whole song.
There must be cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's very difficult to gather 25 people in one place.
I'll start by contacting Youssef and the others, and I'll ask them to gather in one place.
Consider the song and the lyrics.
And there is another way.
I'm recording my part.
He continues.
So record and send it to me.
And delve into other experiences.
Collect some CDs by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experience and techniques?
Of course, we always
Classifiers have been working on it for years and are extensive in the field.
We listen to them, learn the techniques, and try to find a unique line.
Because we do the same thing, with the same tone, and the same expressions,
We don't produce anything new, we want to do something.
So we benefit a little from them.
Yes, there is also a large class of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
Simply put, let's watch the report together for both benefit and entertainment, let's watch it together.
These skills that some people possess are a delight.
Using very simple tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Adil
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I'm from the capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh.
He has good experience and skills.
Discovering groundwater sites underground
Deeper than one hundred meters
You know that using the sea involves a lot of money.
Determining the appropriate location to dig the well, but with the specialist, can.
Discover, find
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
My father, my grandmother, my grandmother, my grandmother
It was used to get expert help in locating wells.
To bring down
Abu Ibrahim's methods in groundwater research
Not considered modern technologies.
Or soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's mercy in his work.
It is an underground water source.
Either apple slices or apple slices.
Lemon branches or fruit branches
Now, the process of discovering water sources is applied scientifically.
To close, this is the end of the stream.
Go back again.
Go back
So, from here we start marking.
And there, the river ends.
He needs a great deal of experience and patience.
The ability to know the sensitivity of the tows' movement.
I traveled to many places.
Which means a 95% success rate.
Of course, in this way and using metal columns.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
What really surprises is the success rate among those practicing this primitive profession.
Exceeds 95%
A search for surface and marine water sources
Praise be to Allah, who taught mankind what they did not know. This report is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Who got their own crew and more than an album.
Regarding the internet or by phone
Sometimes there are confrontations between Gulf countries, such as Qatar against Bahrain and Qatar against Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song with stronger themes.
Facing a problem, etc., there are a large number of issues.
I see myself as my ideal.
God wants
And so at the same time we want to
Releasing a wide range of songs
What can enable
Sometimes, let's keep in touch with you.
Because we know the team's latest news.
But let's focus on the name of the group.
She is a rapper.
We return to our guests in the beautiful waterfront of Juhu.
We remind you of the live broadcast together through this link.
Wherever you are in Konrich, you'll find the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and the nobility of the arts.
Deals with various social and psychological youth issues.
But he only has two with us in the lab.
I'm sure they represent the rest of them.
Yusuf and Salim, hello again.
Sometimes subscriptions expire.
We tried to reach the company, but no one answered.
As a team, you need to improve, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Group name
We will be among the first search results.
Organize and participate together in this large institution.
You film and coordinate images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or download it from YouTube or websites that contain videos and can be followed.
There are some, we've done it before.
There is a large number of songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company to hire you, or a website.
You really need a place where you can all meet as a group.
What are your desires, what do you want to achieve and obtain?
Who supports us?
And prepare an album for us.
I want it to become official.
Because we spent five years.
As he likes, no more.
Yes, we've shared some things, some series.
We hope it improves.
And to have someone who supports us and is with us.
Yes, Salman, we want to know what your wishes are?
I just want to produce a short video.
We would like to succeed for you.
We want all your songs to become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
And bear questions, as you said before.
Best of luck, I wish you all success.
Write "Hello to the group, and we would like to wish you success."
We'll get rid of the verse you made specifically for the program.
This is KD's program and DJ MREldoha.
A blessed summit, ladies and sisters.
This is KJ, Ms. Bobo with SKT, one hot body.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Eldoa program.
We are shown on television, for the public.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30, everyone must watch it.
Let's see what one plus one plus one adds up to.
Together from dawn till dusk.
A product of Hesan Nawama, presented by Shaima Al-Hamadi.
The president is Nasser Al-Malaqi, and the guests are Rabers from Qatar, of course.
It can be repeated again and used at home.
Like a vehicle or a shopping cart
While shopping in the store
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in
A big secret reveals the components of this product.
That was an excellent and practical idea.
Simply scan code, scan in cart detects item.
Simplifying the purchasing process for the customer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I believe this increases health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
The details are complete.
Or the dream, for example, there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Who deals with issues of motion.
It addresses the problem of traffic congestion and other issues such as the parking problem, and was very innovative and beautiful.
Insha'Allah, the Culture Center for Children
Mr. Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, and that's why there are surprises, but we'll talk about them briefly.
Thoughts, I don't know if you want to mention some of the submitted projects or not.
For example, for underground transportation, the brilliant idea is
As soon as a person leaves their house, they find an elevator.
And united in one point.
I assume that all viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
From the creativity of children
Exactly, this is an example of what a vending machine looks like.
For ladies, for example, I have a card.
Go inside, and tell them I need a T-shirt.
This is an example of some shops, or if you lose things at home, like the key.
What is missing, for example, the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Queen Moza.
His Excellency's wife
At an early age, this has great significance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
As they invited us as speakers and orators.
Yes, she was the one who held the last celebration.
To showcase their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be there and provide support, it's a priority for us.
These programs and activities serve the main idea.
Consistent congratulations from consistent types of boastful people.
Self-development
Excellent, are there any collaborations with Al-Shabab Club in Qatar?
Since there are science clubs in Qatar
Of course, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
This is all a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in developing these skills
Involvement of all concerned institutions
The Allegorical League
The creativity hub for girls, and perhaps the role of the office handed over to the ministers was very important as well.
Yes, they played a crucial role in articulating Qatar's vision.
And training children on it.
Engaging and encouraging children, with every program built on institutional partnerships.
According to the head of projects and establishments.
And what about it?
Being here in Katara gives us a strong boost and support.
And faster.
We are now, in collaboration with Katara, preparing for projects that will launch in the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially concerning reading.
Head of the Supreme Family Council
That's what we're doing, especially since we're in the preparation stage.
To build a bright future for all children, the next generation, and youth
What is the final word you want to say to the parents and children watching us now who are interested in joining the center?
Better than what we offer them now.
Sometimes our children present ideas that we should not neglect.
We think about their ideas regardless of what they are.
Because when we take it seriously, it will grow, at least we will encourage the child to think.
So it's important to provide care and attention to the child.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
It supports him.
And to motivate them, we encourage parents to do so.
Pay more attention to a child's imagination, for today's children are the roots of the future.
We took a tour of the exhibition and saw their projects.
Live our dream.
Imagination and ideas were vast.
Dreams become reality, and many of them have achieved it and made it a reality.
Thank God, we wish success for our children who were there.
Our hearts are with you.
God wants
They are of different ages and different nationalities.
Up to seventy projects
It is considered a justified and clear initiative and should be implemented.
Talk more about this national exhibition.
And the Child Culture Center as well.
Mr. Abdull, please briefly explain to us about the exhibition.
There were a lot of activities, so what can you say about him?
The children displayed a new pattern of expressing loyalty and belonging to their country.
She was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
During the visit to the exhibition
Grows until it reaches 20 or 30.
I started training children to envision Qatar's National Vision 2030 across all its three pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, knowing Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, one must start thinking about
Creative ideas, and the creative thinking approach.
I think they already have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will become more and more.
Sir, you launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Reality or the Homeland of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of Generations"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt like we were walking with the children, when the child said to the minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for twenty or thirty minutes.
A child thinking about the future in twenty years.
They express their love for their countries in the field they are interested in.
There should be some activities, events, and competitions.
Someone won the Science Stars prize.
There were the winners of the first Arab League competition.
Of course, all children.
At the end, there were various performances according to a set schedule.
To display the projects they have done
Large existence, very distinctive quality.
Stars of science
Some winners of projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
The forest, or the innovative and creative reserve.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also one of the children's dreams and a vision for Qatar's future.
This is an idea for twenty or thirty.
How can a child share a creative idea in twenty or thirty?
The basic plan is that there's a crate in the ball.
The player is given a colored warning by the referee.
For example, the modifier can monitor the movement of the ball.
Or change the field through this electronic board.
This is fixed to the ball.
There are creative ideas, of course, the main idea, some might ask.
And projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express national honesty through these projects.
Giving them confidence in how to present the project, dealing with the audience, and explaining their ideas.
In a field he loves, connected to something he loves, all of this is an achievement.
Provided support, we thank him for that.
which is now in the development stage
As supported by the public, the committee, and a number of officials, the projects were launched.
First, no, it was the second, because this girl.
Pipes, channels for the audience to enter underground, and the way viewers enter need arrangement.
A very large forest reserve
Where the visitor can go and see animals and predators.
There is also a sensor attached to some animals to examine their condition.
There is also the marine environment, and the way of entry is also innovative.
One of the reasons for her success is her broad and comprehensive imagination.
All this made her eligible to win.
There is another person who talked about an underwater tourist city.
Bead City
A forest on Earth.
Many tourist ideas
We are concerned.
Maybe this is something on their minds at this time, maybe in twenty or thirty years.
And it will be achieved in the future.
Three projects.
Endorsed by the Science Club, she said these projects are what we need to work on.
Present project, excess air moisture.
Let's look at Al Raya newspaper.
The article states that Qatar University is celebrating a graduation ceremony.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud.
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Chairman of the Higher Education Council
And Professor Suhail bint Abdullah Al-Maysanad, President
Register a new record for the university for sure.
Qatar University and Calgary University

He is considered one of the young actors who are strongly introduced to the stage of Qatar.
Even so, also tassels and colored chains.
Theatrical actor Abdel Hamid Charshani is considered one of the founding actors.
If it's not convincing,
He will not be chosen to join projects implemented within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdelhamid Charshani is participating in two series: "The Threatened Feeling" and "Tissaneef" Part Two.
We are happy that he is our guest today.
Let's talk to him about his involvement in these two works and his overall experience.
Welcome and good morning.
Welcome to the Doha Morning Show. This is the first time I'm meeting you, and it's your first time participating in the Doha Morning Show.
With people who make an effort to implement the program.
And you, Lady Lisa.
Welcome. Let's start the conversation after we greet each other.
Let's see.
I am a responsible man and a responsible leader.
And I enforce the rules.
The only thing I can say to you,
Give me a bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them, if any of them agrees that you don't return the trousers.
Of course, I have another question as an introduction, but since we've seen this part of the series Tesaneef Part 1.
He pointed to Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Some orientalists attribute the well-known poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marib.
A lot of things and information related to the same city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch with you this special report from our colleague Abdulrahman Al-Marshed.
So let's watch it together.
So it is certainly the testimony of people who know about the existence of balance or preference.
And as a confirmation of the march of these cities or other cities.
As we see from its ancient ruins and what we hear from its judges and poets.
Classical and modern, so this is an important record added to the city's history.
Marat City is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it was an ancient town established in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a disagreement among Orientalists about how to name it.
Someone believed that the name became famous after the renowned poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the river that is called Bese.
The date of its foundation is unknown.
In the tribal era.
The famous thing in the city of Marrat is Mount Comait, where many judgments have been made against it.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Stop. These are historical places.
This place is considered a tourist attraction in Saudi Arabia.
The Marrat urban area has made a great effort to achieve this.
The text of the research is above this mountain.
And seating places for the residents and all the people in the kingdom.
She was named after the Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, and Allah welcomed him.
To overthrow Muslims and Muslimah writers.
From its sources, the Komait River flows.
This is a place where river waters are collected and regulated for a long period.
It was one of the most important water sources in the past.
From its ancient ruins to the Doha Heritage House.
A city passed and was able to survive from the early Muslim era.
He was renowned for his poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, its monuments, and its famous mountains, Komait.
Abu Rahma is the guide for the Doha Morning Program.
Marat City, south of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
I want you to tell us and give us and give the viewers about these methods and techniques.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is a very unique kind.
We opened a page for him and registered him with a special record in our system.
He was monitored by the supervisor.
This report contains the extent of increased attention, speed of writing, speed of reading, and degree of general busyness.
The supervisor gets a full report.
Undoubtedly, I will add this report to the student's record.
Logs into his son's online account.
He watches his son's progress.
He can see his average and focus with the teachers.
Because we really enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
Because we want to gather most of the children at the center, we send them our best regards.
Who entered this place with the teacher?
For we know her skill and the position she has reached beyond her income in the center.
Of course, this year.
Focus on one task and after Ramadan.
But of course this affects other works, always.
Some people only watch TV during the month of Ramadan.
He keeps the darkness at bay, watching TV, as people tune in to the months of worship depicted on the screen.
Less, less, less chain, less, less, they can provide work every two domains, is this better?
Of course.
I wish they love me in Ramadan.
But I'd like to send you all my best wishes.
And I hope that
And also with plays.
From theater to fashion.
A fashion show was held at Qatar's Cultural Center.
Of course, we continue with you with great love and sincerity.
And develop the potential and skills of children more.
Different from the various schools in this vented country.
We have a template, and we've spoken with the guest we previously identified.
Now we are joined by Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdel Salam, good morning.
How are you, Omania?
I'm fine.
What grade are you in school now?
Dr. Ibrahim, to start, could you please tell us about the course offered by the center?
And Omonia is an example of that.
We will also try the method or approach that Ms. Nesma mentioned with her.
Do you feel there's a difference in his mind?
Do you feel that these skills and techniques,
The thing about his mental skills or even his level of education will change.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure that level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now a test or something similar will be held.
It will calculate and move immediately.
Of course, Omneh doesn't know anything about the questions.
We amazed them with the same thing.
Of course, I'll ask another question to start.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution, can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we aired the first part of the Tisanev series,
Thank God, I was versatile in several roles.
Mr. Ghaneim,
Roles are distributed under the supervision of Executive Director Ashraf Shahata with the gentlemen.
This is an opportunity from Tara for artistic production.
For teenagers.
Mr. Ghaneim elected me this year to
Of course, each episode is different.
I have in more than one series where I play different characters.
On the other hand, this is a wonderful experience. In this work, we have
A pyramid among the pyramids of Kuwait, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have representatives from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al-Ghaith.
As Ali Mirza, we
You also have a team of young actors like Abdullah Adel.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Asama.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two works a year.
This might be the reason why I asked you before I started streaming. You've been operating since 1997.
But you've achieved nothing, or your ambition to act.
Thank God for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I took acting as a talent. In the beginning, it was the actor Abdulaziz Jassim who took me under his wing.
He is one of the actors who looks at me as if I were his son.
If you need anything, call me.
We were in all his shows.
We worked hard, thank God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thank you to Mr. Andolrahmen Salawi, and a very special thank you to Mr. Abdurrahman.
If you compare with Kuwait, in Kuwait, 12 to 16 new participants join every year. Why?
They have.
Of course, many thanks for this, as it offers many opportunities.
But let's assume that
Let's talk about the other series, we were at the idea of Tessanif.
We need to know the feeling of being threatened.
And also the foot.
We have a sample, we have with us the specialist therapist Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Mayouf Al-Tamimi.
To get this procedure on air.
And we can see how we deal with the person. First, I will say good morning to Subhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Welcome, peace be upon you.
So let's start with you, sir, please.
If God wills.
In the name of God
We hold hands.
We see the nerves.
As if it were a painting or a message from God Almighty, revealing all the parts of your body.
From the inside and its problems.
It makes you feel dizzy sometimes.
I have a headache and feel nauseous.
Put out your hand, put out your hand. Relax your mind, yes.
By doing that, Mr. Abdulaziz will discover something specific from his hand, that he suffers from a specific disease.
On his left side. His ear, he has a mild ear infection in the middle ear.
There is pain! What does that mean, Sir Abdul Aziz?
Headphones. Do you have a hearing problem?
You were born to me and I was born old.
Do you also have pain here?
This is the pointed ear!
Do you have a nose ache and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He is sick with ear and nose problems.
It gives him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without food.
The metaphorical attachment from its place, acts upon the place and acts upon the place and acts upon
I sleep a lot.
Either you're late or you're a slacker, you always feel tired.
Your ear is always getting infected.
Here. Look at the shake, you notice the shake.
He's affected by the tension and you're walking without feet, maybe for the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned him.
Is this treatment beneficial for both children?
A mother's fingers, according to the mercy of God, are the size of an infant's fist.
Many children don't sleep, why?
When you carry him, he doesn't like to be carried, but people think he loves to be carried. He has gases in his belly, God bless him.
When the mother puts up her middle finger, she's extending her middle finger.
In the baby's hand.
The hands are perpendicular and the child is perpendicular to them.
Let's watch this, so every mother learns this move.
You'll change the pressure like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This is about the child, about, about, about the child, and it's excellent.
Undoubtedly, when it comes to discoveries, you have specific discoveries particularly for women.
As we said, every house with 90% women is blessed by God.
The first thing, the first warning from the bricks to the ground.
When we walk on mud without feet, we are allowed to walk without feet, but walking on a flat surface is dangerous.
Go with your eyes wide open! The evidence is when clay is used in homes, health problems increase.
Because it's cold and stable.
When it was covered with carpets, there were problems, they suffered from breathing difficulties.
Increased.
A woman should focus on walking without using her feet on the lower limb.
This is the part of the foot and the attributed part, which is at the back, the attributed.
From here, this is the foot, and now under the lower end.
This is a first discovery, and the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Focus with me for a moment.
In the seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just being in the delivery month.
This means they don't come on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is walking without feet.
A pregnant woman should be careful not to walk barefoot.
If it's in its place,
I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan, "And you will see the garden descending upon you, and you will see the sacrifice descending upon you."
We already know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her sources come to her.
I spoke with academics and they informed me: Why has the interpretation of Ibn Kathir changed?
He told me: "I give you the idea that God has placed in this science, and it beats within me."
The trunk of the praying tree swayed towards you. When the tree sways, what does it look like?
This is sharp just like blades or sticks.
When you shake the tree, orders are given to the womb, which is the area in the middle.
This is the internal organs, and it gives orders to facilitate the birth of the fetus and put it back again.
The elevation of the fetal head or repositioning, until it descends naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
And he gives your hand and moves to relax.
Some take it as a practice, others know it as a science.
Therefore they fear to tell you, and do not believe in them.
Yes. Sir Abdul Aziz, your discoveries are important.
But I want to ask you one last question because time has flown by.
If someone wants to get in touch with you, any someone who wishes to communicate with you, any specific email or simply you.
No problem, the mobile number is available in the control room. If anyone wants to contact Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, on a sector TV, so he can contact us and take this number.
I was created to serve people only.
If we want to believe in this belief, God will bless your work and people will be satisfied.
I make mistakes like the rest of people, and do everything you can imagine, I'm an ordinary person.
But we strive for good more than that.
We always think of good things.
Welcome, viewers. I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand therapy.
And through the foot as well.
We saw a live demonstration on air of how the disease that the person was suffering from was discovered.
And the difficulties he faces. I hope we can benefit from him, and if anyone wants to contact him, they can read about him through the internet.
The way you will implement it, whether in the coming days or in the coming years, and whether it will include more schools.
Your promotion is congratulated.
What do you think of this experiment?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
In fact, obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So, we feared that Qatar would become the fifth state with them.
This program, in fact, happened to be the First Lady in New York.
Visit Doha, they have a program for that.
They offered it to us, we accepted it and said, "Alright."
Our students with students from New York, Istanbul, and England.
Therefore, we can notice the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is what we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
He abstains from exercise.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone.
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience. Thank God, we are at the end of the day.
We are proud of our students.
You know they were independent schools, for boys Abu 'Abbadah,
Raquia Independent Girls' School
And with a Muhammadan soul.
The family became more aware, the siblings' emotions at home, and they started eating this food like them.
An independent culture developed among the students, which they carried back home to their families.
This goes and tells them, I was given this or I was taught this.
The training staff or whoever provided this information to the students,
How did I choose him and how was the student contacted? Who made the contact?
Yes, there were many parties that helped us, may God reward them generously.
We have siblings at the diet center who teach them about healthy food of course.
And learn from Lady Isa Al-Tamimi dining skills.
How they organize themselves, how they organize their priorities!
To learn cooking, sports, or raise awareness about the value of healthy foods.
It was in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum, or
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
A day was organized at the beginning of the program in the ASPER system, where we gathered all the male and female students.
This is not something linked to a specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible because they are our children.
Students who deal with them at first!
She initially said the results were satisfactory.
Is it sufficient to have two classes or specific grades in these schools?
Now, when an experiment starts in the world, it doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts from a reasonable range that contains all the features; dazzling, girl, independent, and private.
Because it is not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, as if they accept things for their children and deny others.
The truth is that they want to participate in it, and this is considered to be very important.
A 12- or 13-year-old student, this is the right time for him to learn about his health.
This is a misfortune for many people who wish to lose weight, but they imagine it to be impossible.
Some of the actors we saw in the movies as ladies, say that this is impossible, no!
We discussed in detail, but there were a large number of weeks that we couldn't cover.
And through his conquest of Doha, we can remind them of that.
And the fruits and vegetables containing vitamin B that you can get from fruits and vegetables.
So one should know the benefits of fruits and understand that by eating them, their health improves and their condition stabilizes.
As for fruits, I went to the store and picked out the fruits.
So, that's a point.
This is diversity, and certainly they compete, and each school was innovative with the different ideas of its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We provide guidelines, and everyone should take the initiative to innovate.
Did the guides train the student, or do you have a special team?
We trained them, we trained them.
But teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would hold activities for students on Saturday.
This is a day outside of school hours, they acknowledge and agree to it; the Raqqa school said they will hold a gathering.
They said they would have a day for healthy cooking for the girls, but we didn't require the boys to cook healthy food for themselves, and the girls were more skilled at it.
I would also like to thank Rayyan Water Company for providing all the water free of charge to the students, Rayyan Water Company in this regard.
Of course, water is healthier because it cleanses your body of all the toxic substances that enter it daily through food.
We said the third week.
That is, his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball, and he doesn't know that this is the game I love.
True, true, precise, and perhaps some want another game, maybe they don't like team games.
Welcome with us live.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and president of the Qatari Multiple Cancer Society, welcomes us.
Of course, we try to focus on the important topics as much as possible.
We would like to introduce our colleagues to the concept of sclerosis and provide them with an understanding of what it is.
Because this name could be embarrassing for us too.
There were more women than men.
All the treatments available now are preventive treatments.
The white cells that are supposed to protect us start to
He kills us by striking the nerve cells.
I simplify it for the public, it's like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, let's say it's the nylon layer.
Of course, it usually leads to dizziness and loss of vision and loss of vision.
It also led to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In its worst case, it leads to madness, to catatonia or paraplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions of the body will be badly affected.
Or from these diseases a disease called multiple cancer.
Some theories say it's a viral transmission.
The disease is not an epidemic.
Not inherited by the two children.
Some people are considered a disease depending on the region.
For example, the equator was excluded from this study.
Now, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease has not been cured yet because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists are unable to find the cause of the disease, until they find a cure.
Now reverse the process.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might feel a little afraid of this subject, as we can say that this disease comes as a surprise.
Is there a specific group, a community where you feel this illness has spread within a specific group?
At the international level, it was ranked between twenty and forty.
Now the number of members in the international society has decreased from twenty to fifteen.
Because it started attracting young people up to the age of forty.
But man does not recover from it.
Of course, as a society, we welcome alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the community, the Cancer Patients Union in Qatar.
Why do we own this society?
It was a large group, so I thought about forming an association for this subject.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, he says there are 16,000 cases.
A thousand cases.
Other countries in the Gulf range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five to seven years ago,
My number was forty-six.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is actually suffering from this disease?!
We don't know if it's a virus, so we don't want to commit to a specific theory, that's the point.
The other point is how do I know if I'm getting it or not.
This is very difficult.
I'm insane, Mr. Abdulaziz, the experience of finding a specific point.
