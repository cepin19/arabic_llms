Jesus invented a small child and forgot him. And the child forgot among them.
Yasus said: "What I am telling you is true. You can change and become like children. If you do not change, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven."

Whoever has mercy on a little child like this in my name has mercy on me.
But what if one of these corrupt leaders who believe in me leads others astray? If he does, it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.

If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The story of the lost rabbit.
Know how to look into the midst of these. This is what I told you. They deserve to see themselves in heaven, for they are worthy to see my Father who is in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Imagine a man has 100 cows and one runs away. Does he leave the 99 cows on the mountain and go after the one that ran away?
What I'm about to tell you is a fact. If this goat is found, it will make more than 99 goats happy that they didn't run away.
So it is with your heavenly Father. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you...
If your brother commits a sin after that, go to him and tell him what he did, and keep it between the two of you. And if he hears you, you have won him over.
But what if he doesn't hear you? Follow up with one or two others. The Scripture says, "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell it to the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I'm going to tell you is true. What you lock on earth remains locked in heaven. What you open on earth remains open in heaven.
Again, this is what I tell you. Imagine you and your partner on earth agreeing on anything you ask for. My Father in heaven will do it for you.
"If people gather two or three in my name, I am with them." Safety for those who were not tormented.
"Prepare yourself to prepare yourself to prepare yourself to prepare yourself to prepare yourself."
Jesus replied, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sows good seed in his field.
The king was about to start his work, holding in his hand the one who deserved millions of dollars.
The man was unable to pay. So the owner issued an order. As a result, the man had to sell his wife, children, and all he owned to pay off his debt.
"Put on your shoes," he said, "and tie the laces." "I can do everything myself," she replied.
His master taught him and gave him what he deserved and gave him what he deserved.
But afterwards, the son found one of the servants who deserved it with a few dollars. He expanded it and started to tighten it. "Pay me what you owe me!" he said.
"The secret follower is on his heels." "Send me back in time," he said. "I will return you."
But the first servant refused. So he went and delivered the debtor to the jail, where the debtor is to remain until he pays back all he owes.
The other servants saw what happened. They were very upset. They went and told the owner everything that had happened.
Then the master treated the Muslim first. "You are the safety of my slave," he said. "I have fulfilled all that I owe you after you asked of me."
Why did you treat the other servant better than you treated me?
Due to anger, the owners turned against the prisoners, and he will be punished until he gives back everything in his hands.
So shall each one of you be treated in heaven as you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
Jesus Teaches about Divorce
Since Jesus had spoken openly about this, He left Galilee and went to the region of Judea across the Jordan.
Read large groups and heal them there.
Some of the Parisians were coming.
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female? (Genesis 1:27)"
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
Let there be no division among you, but let you be united, as Christ Jesus called you to one hope.
They said, "Then why was Moses commanded to give the man a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I tell you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she is unfaithful to him.
The students told him, "If this is how it is between a husband and wife, it's better they don't get married."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who have received help to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men are unable to marry and have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by people. Others were made that way in order to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should live it. "Little children are given to be eunuchs."
Some people brought little children to Jesus, asking him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples rebuked the people.
Yeshua said, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to those who are like children."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and a young owner.
Surely he sent a man to test him. He said, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Who?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not be afraid, do not be afraid, do not be afraid, do not be afraid, do not be afraid."
Honor your parents. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I followed all those orders," the young man said. "What else is left for me to do?"
Jesus replied, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he turned and collapsed. He was very wealthy.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again, it is hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. But it is harder for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. And they asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter replied, "We've left everything to follow you! What is the reward that will be given to us?"
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus said to them. "When all things are created, the Son of Man will be recorded on his radiant kingdom. Then will arise over 12 thrones of my judges. The 12 tribes of Israel will flourish."
Everyone who has left a house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
Workers' biography in the field
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a piece of land. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
I agree to give them the usual wages for a day's work. Then send them to his farm.
It was already nine o'clock in the morning when he went out again. He saw the rest of the people standing in the market doing something important.
He told them, "Clean up my bathroom and do the dishes, and I'll pay you what you're worth."
She was walking. "He went out again at noon, at three o'clock, and at six o'clock, and did the same thing."
"Five went out, teaching and preaching, while the rest remained behind. He asked them, 'Why are you holding back today, without doing anything?'"
"Because no one asked us," they replied. "He told them, 'Invent and make in my scientific house.'"
"What have you accomplished tonight?" the farm owner asked the foreman. "Pay the workers their wages, starting with those hired most recently and then moving to those hired first."
Only five workers were hired. Each one received a day's wage.
Those who cooperated first expected to get more. But each of them got the same amount today.
Since they received it, they started complaining to the owner.
"The people who showed up last only worked for one hour," they said. "You paid them the same amount. We did most of the work and we were in the hot sun all day."
The guardian replied to one of them. "I promise you fairly," he said, "how much do you usually earn in a day?"
Take your time and leave. I want to pay the amount you owed me yesterday, the same amount you paid me.
Can't I dispose of my own money as I please? Do you feel wasted because I gave my money to others?
"So whoever finishes, finishes, and whoever finishes, finishes. Jesus speaks again of his death."
Jesus was going to Jerusalem. On the way, he chose 12 disciples to go with him.
"We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
They will greet him for two people who are not greeted by the Jews. They will allow him and they will bring him out. They will bring him out on his knee. On the ninth day, he will return from yesterday! A nation asking Jesus will ask him.
"Mama, my brother and I reached Jesus. She clung to him and begged him to help."
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant me that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Yasus said to them, "I will drink from my cup. But what follows, I will say who will be recorded on my right or on my left. These positions are for those chosen by my Father."
The remaining ten heard this. Their anger towards the brothers intensified.
He politicized their treatment. He said, "Recognize the wise men of the nation. They control their people. And they receive orders from their higher officials."
Don't be like that. Rather, anyone who wants it to become important between you, remains your slave.
And whoever wants it to remain, let your guardians be.
Be like a human. He did not come to be related. But he came to relate others. He came to relate his life as a span to liberate many. Two disabled men are seen in their eyes.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
Two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that Jesus was passing by. They shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The people were taught to stop, and taught to be silent. But the two men whispered, "God! Son of David! Forgive us!"
Jesus stopped and walked up to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"God," she said, "we want to be able to see."
Yaseen was interested in the arrow. He made eye contact with them. They understand. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go to the next village. When you arrive, you will find a mare and her foal. Untie them and send them to me."
If anything is told to you, say that the gentlemen might be interested. The kingdom will send them immediately.
This was to fulfill what the prophet had said. It is said,
"Say to the city of peace: 'See, your King comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey' (Zechariah 9:9)"
The students followed and did what Jesus told them.
They led out the horse and the duck. They placed their clothes on them. Then Jesus drew a line on the clothes.
Many of them turned their faces towards the house, while others spread out a mat of leaves and lay down on the house.
Some of the people went ahead of him, and some followed, shouting: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
As Jesus entered the southern part of Jerusalem, the situation in the city became tense. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The people replied, "This is Jesus. He is the messenger from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus came out of the Temple at Temin.
Jesus entered the temple. He began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "God said, 'My house will be a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you are making it a den of robbers" (Jeremiah 7:11).
The seeing and those who were afflicted came to Jesus at the altar. He healed them there.
The adults and the learned men saw what he had done, and they saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these people are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," Jesus replied. "Haven't you read," they retorted, "that it was said to the fathers, 'You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain'?" (Matthew 12:2)
So Jesus went away from the crowd and retired to the town of Bethsaida. And a day passed. A fruit tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was going back to Jerusalem. He was lame.
He saw a fruit tree by the road. He approached the tree and found on it nothing but leaves. Then he said to it, "Never bear fruit!" And the tree withered at once.
When they saw this, their admiration grew. "How did the fruit tree dry up so quickly?" they asked.
Yasus replied, "What I am telling you is true. Believe and you will doubt. Then you can do what was done to the tree. And you can command the mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. A question of Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered a mosque. While he was teaching, the children and the adults approached him. "By what authority are you doing this?" they asked. "Who gave you this authority?"
Yassos replied, "I'll ask you one question. If you hesitate, I'll tell you in context why I do this."
"Where did John get his heroine? From the sky? Or from among the people?" They exchanged glances. They said, "If we say from the sky, he will ask, 'Then why didn't you know her?'"
But what if we say "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you the context of what I am doing. The story of the two sons."
How do you understand this? There was a man who had two sons. He said to the first, "Son, go out and work in the vineyard today."
"I can't," the son replied. But later he changed his mind and set off.
Then the father sent another son. He said the same thing to him. The son replied, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they said. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
You should know the right way to live. And you don't believe in it. But the tax collectors and sinners do believe. You have seen it. But even this does not change your error and your belief. The story of the tax collectors
You will hear another story. A man had land, and he planted an olive grove. He put a wall around it. He dug a winepress. He built a watchtower. He leased the grove to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the storage time approached, he sent his slaves to the people who shared. And he ordered the slaves to gather his share of the fruit.
But the poor penetrated his servants. Strike one of them. Kill another. Throw stones at the third to kill him.
Then the man sent two more salads to the table. He sent them more than once the first time. And the waiter treated them the same way.
In the end, he sent his son to them. "They will respect my son," he said.
But the poor saw the son die. So they said to them, "This is the one who took the owner's entire wealth one day. Accuse him, let us consume him, for everything will be ours."
They took him and transported him from the olive grove. Then they killed him.
How does the owner of the forbidden (wealth) treat the poor person when he asks for help?
"These people will destroy the evil," they replied. "Then they will hand over the farm to another. And they will attribute a share of the harvest to him at storage time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
So this is what I tell you. The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to those who produce fruit.
Whoever falls on that stone is broken, but the stone is broken by whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was speaking about them.
She was looking for a way to stop him. But they were afraid of the crowds. People thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding anniversary biography
Jesus told them many stories. He said,
Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent his servant to those who were invited to the dinner. And the servant kept telling them to come. But they refused.
So he sent messengers to them. He said, "Inform those you have been invited, that I am ready for the dinner. I have slaughtered my cow and prepared the food. Everything is ready. Come to the dinner."
But people did not reflect. One went absent to his field. Another went absent to his affair.
The rest they corrupted, and treated them with harshness and killed them.
The king remained enthusiastic. He sent his army to defeat them. They killed those criminals and burned their city.
So the king said to his servants, "The feast is ready, but those I invited are not worthy to come."
Go out to the roads and invite to the dinner whoever you find.
The workers were going out onto the street, gathering everyone they could find, whether good or bad. The wedding hall was quickly filled with guests.
The king entered to look at the guests and noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"Friends," he asked, "how did you get in here without a wedding suit?" The man couldn't say anything.
Then the queen told her servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the darkness outside. This people will weep, and their buckets will be empty."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They devised a plan to entrap Jesus in His words.
"They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. 'Teacher,' they said, 'we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, and you don't cater to their whims. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to the Roman emperor or not?'"
Explain to us, what is your opinion? Is it permissible to pay taxes to a tyrant or not?
But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said, "You are the ones who are evil! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the purchased mover. They made it of silver.
I asked him, "Who is the image of the Hulk? And who are the words of the Hulk?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished. They forgot their grief and went away. Marriage when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people rise from the dead.
"The doctor," they said, "this is what Moses commanded us: 'If a man dies without having a son, his brother shall marry his wife, and they shall have a son who shall bear the name of the deceased brother.'"
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died, leaving children. So his wife remained with the eldest brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It even happened to the seventh brother.
In the end, the lady died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will they be? For the seven were married to her.
Yesis replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptur, and you do not know the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry, nor will their parents give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
And what do you say about the dead who rise? Do you not know what God has told you?
He said, "I am the Lord who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I am the Lord who brought you out of the land of slavery. And I am the Lord who redeemed you." (Exodus 6:6) He is the God who brought the dead to life. He is the God who brought the chosen ones to life.
When the crowds heard this, they understood what he was teaching. The most important commands.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, so they joined forces.
One of them was a lawyer. So Jesus asked him a question.
"Teacher", he asked, "What is the most important command in the law?"
Jesus replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and fundamental command.
"Love your neighbor as yourself." (Luke 19:18)
All that is written in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments. Who is the Christ?
The horses are harnessed. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Whose Son is He?" "The Son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit was speaking through David himself. David said,
God said to my Lord, "Write down on My right hand, that I may overcome My enemies" (Psalms 110:1)
As if David calls him "Lord," how can he be David's son?
No one could refute him in words. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus pronounces judgment on the Pharisees and the scribes.
Yasees made it simple for the people why the Muslim prostrates.
"Muslim and Jewish children are equal in the eyes of Moses," he said.
So, you must follow them. Do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do. Because they don't practice what they preach.
Weights are tied and carried on people's shoulders. But they don't want to lift a finger to move them.
Everything he does, he does it to be seen by people. They wear small boxes containing verses from the Book on their heads, exalting themselves. They make the boxes wide and increase the length of the branches on their clothes.
They like to sit in the places of honor at meals. They also like to get the most important places in the church.
They love the welcome in the markets. They love what they call "rabbi."
But what you call "Lord" has only one worthy of the name, and you are all brothers and sisters.
Do not call anyone on earth 'Father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
Do not call anyone "teacher," for you have one teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you is your worship.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
How will it be for you then, teachers of the truth and Jews! You who call for the truth! You kill the King of Heaven in the faces of things. You did not enter, and no one could enter who could.
(No
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are."
How often have you, who are the chosen ones, said, "If anyone makes a vow by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone makes a vow by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his vow"?
You are a hypocrite and a traitor! Which is greater? Is it gold? Or is it the mosque where gold prays?
Hayek says: "If you make a promise to someone in the name of the altar, it doesn't matter, but if you make a promise to someone in the name of the gift that is on the altar, that is respected."
Of course you care! What is certain? Is it the sacrifice? Or is it the spot that makes the sacrifice sacred?
Clay leaves only when he finishes on cold, he finishes on cold and that's it, everything is done.
And whoever denies the name of the mosque denies his name and what is in it.
And whoever lies about the name of the heavens lies about the name of the King of God and about the Messiah, the Messiah.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former."
Of course your directions! Remove the small insect from your food, but you eat a whole sentence!
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You blind guides! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean."
A well-spoken Persian! Heal the wound first, then the site will be outside the proportion.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
As it is with you. From the outside, you seem to be doing what is healthy. But from the inside, you are filled with what is wrong. You claim to be what you follow.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to."
And you would lie: "If we lived in the days of those who lived before us, we would not have done so. We would not have contributed to the killing of the messengers."
Thus you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who killed the messengers.
Complete the evil deeds that those who lived before you have started!
You're a poisoned squirrel's nest! How do you escape being punished in hell?
So I sent to you the messengers, the scholars, and the professors. Some of them you will improve. Some of them you will improve on the line. And some of them you will use in your mosques. You will improve them from city to city.
Thus you will pay for the blood of all the righteous people who have worked on the earth. I mean from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah. It is Zechariah whom they killed between the altar and the temple.
What I'm going to tell you is true. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
My house is empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord" (Psalm 118:26)
End of the world symptoms
Jesus changed the altar. He was walking and his disciples fell in attendance of his presence. They wanted to direct his attention to the altar buildings.
"Do you see these things?" asked Jesus. "What I am telling you now is true. Not one stone will be left standing on another. Every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us," they said, "when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus replied, "Drink and quickly get drunk, and let him who deceives you perish."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
You hear about wars, and you hear people talking about future wars. Don't worry, this has to happen. But the end has not yet come.
State will oppose state. Royalty will oppose royalty. People will lack food. Earthquakes will spread in many places.
All this is the beginning of labor pains.
After that, people will submit to you and envy you. All nations will judge you according to what you have done.
At that time, many will turn away from their religion. They will grow accustomed to one another. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will seduce many people.
Because evil increases, people's love grows cold.
But those who stay until the end will succeed.
The news of the kingdom's joy will be proclaimed throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then will come the end.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
The free people in Yuda are fleeing to the mountains.
No one on the roof is allowed to go down to their house and take anything.
No one in the field may go back to change their clothes.
How will he provide for the daughters adopted in their times! How will he provide for the daughters adopted in their times!
Concede to you to be in a hurry in winter or on Saturday.
There will be severe difficulties in those days. They will be worse than anything from the beginning of the world until now. And especially, nothing like it will appear again.
If time never ended, no one would live. But because of the chosen people of God, it will end.
At that time it will be said to you, "Wait! Here is Christ!" or "Here he is!" Do not believe it.
There will appear those who claim to be Christ and those who claim to be prophets. They will perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect of God.
You see, I told you so.
So if anyone tells you, "He's far out in the desert," don't go. Or if anyone tells you, "He's inside the house," don't believe him.
The light that comes from the east is seen in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
The cows will gather at the place of my death.
After the devastating days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.
He will send his angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all these things falling, you know the end is near. It's just a door.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The people who lived in that time period didn't die until all of this happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. The day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. The same will happen when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking tea. They were arranging marriages. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the floods came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will move and the other will stay.
Two women will be chopped up with a hand grinder. One will work, and the other will work.
So stay connected. You do not know what day your Lord will come.
You need to understand something. Imagine the homeowner knew the time of night the criminal would come. So he would stay and watch. He wouldn't allow him to enter his house.
You also must be ready, for the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
As if an owner places one of his servants to manage the other servants in his house. The servant's job is to distribute food at the right time. And the owner calls honest and intelligent servants.
It will be good for the servant if he finds the master working in his job when the master returns.
What I'm about to tell you is true. The trustee will place this employee in charge of everything he owns.
But suppose the worker is malicious. Suppose he thinks to himself: "What if the owner stays away for a long time?"
It's as if he starts beating up other workers, and as if he eats and hangs out with whoever he buys from a lot.
The lord who is a lord offers his house on a day that is not considered. He offers his house on a night he does not know.
After that, the referee stops him and moves him to the area where the competitors go. We'll be crying and gnashing our teeth.
Ten delivered sermons
Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
The five were informants. The five were knowledgeable.
Those who were wise took their lamps, but they took no olive oil.
The two men took oil in cups with their lights.
The husband didn't come for a long time. The two girls collapsed and fell asleep.
Without hesitation, she dedicated the day, "Here is the house! Come out to inspect it!"
Then the two women expanded and learned about finances.
Those who were careless said to those who were careless, "Give us some of your oil, for our light is going out."
"No," they replied. "It may not be enough for all of us. Go to the oil seller and buy some for yourself."
You were going to buy oil. But on their way, the bride's wife arrived. The rest who were inside went in with him for dinner. Then they locked the door.
No, then she sent the others with her. "Sir! Sir!" she said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied: "What I am telling you is true. I don't know you."
So stay in touch. You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom comes. The story of three workers.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each worker an amount of money that he knew the worker could handle. Then he went on the trip.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately resigned, took his money, and left. And he earned an additional $10,000.
The one who won $4000 won an additional $4000.
But the man who received $2000 was not satisfied, so he dug a hole in the ground and buried his money there.
Then the persistent one no longer greeted them. He wanted to collect all the money they had broken.
"The man who received $10,000 sent another $10,000. 'Sir,' he said, 'I have $10,000 with me. See, I've made an extra $10,000.'"
His owners replied, "Well done, Obed is good and trustworthy! You did well, but only a little. I will put you in charge of much. Enter and share your owner's happiness!"
The man who simplified 4000 problems said, "Sir, I simplified 4000 problems with you. I mean, I definitely simplified 4000 problems."
The master said, "You are promoted, good and trustworthy servant! You were trusted little. I will give you much responsibility. Enter and share the master's joy!"
"No," he said later, sending the boy who found $2000. "Sir," he said, "I knew you were a tough man. You reap what you sow. You harvest crops where you don't sow seeds."
I was scared. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Be careful, this is yours.
His owners replied, "You are a consumer, not a producer! Do you know that I reap what I did not sow? Do you know that I gather the harvest without having scattered the seed?"
No, you need to leave my money in the bank. When I returned, I got the amount plus extra money.
Then the judge ruled against the Umariyyin, "They took $2000 from him and distributed it to those who had $20,000."
"For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."
Get this empty worker out of the place. Thus in the dark, people will wait and shiver. "Cows and sheep"
The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven.
He will gather all the people before him. He will continue to separate people into two groups. He will act as a shepherd separating sheep from pigs.
He puts the cow on his right and gives the rabbits to his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right, "Father has favored you. Come, take your inheritance. This kingdom has been prepared for you since the creation of the world.
I was lost, and you found me. I was sick, and you healed me. I was stranger, and you welcomed me.
I needed clothes. And you wished for me. I was sick. And you cooperated with me. I was in prison. And you visited me.
After that, the people who have truly deviated from the right path will ask, "Lord," they will say, "When did we see you in need and feed you? When did we see you thirsty and give you something to drink?"
How did we see you as a king and give you our support? How did we see you as a beggar and take you in?
How were you once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time, once upon a time?
The king will reply, "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you have done to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you have done to me."
"You who are on my left, depart from me! You are cursed, and you will go into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not invite me in. I needed clothes, and you did not provide them. I was sick and in prison, and you did not take care of me.
They will reply: "Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty, and did not serve You? When did we see You a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not serve You?"
He must answer: "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Anything you have not done for the least of these, you have not done for me."
They will go away to be punished forever. But those who do what is right will have eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus continued saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is just two days away. The Son will be offered up for execution on the cross.
Then the sons gathered with the leaders. They gathered in the building of Caiaphas, the son.
They were plotting to arrest Jesus in a stealthy manner. They wanted to kill him.
But only during the feast, they said. "People might cause trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A girl wrote to Lysander, but sent him a sealed bag of expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was asleep.
When they saw this, their anger intensified. "Why is this missing?" they asked.
Olives were sold at a high price. The money was given to poor people.
Jesus knew what they were planning. So he said to them, "Why are you making a fuss over this girl? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
You will always remain poor. But you will not remain together.
She was spraying perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you have done will work anywhere this news is published around the world. It will work in mentioning it. Yoda agrees to deliver Jesus.
One of the twenty went by the name. And his name was Judas Iscariot.
He said to them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From then on, Yoda looked for the opportune time to prompt Jesus to reveal his identity. The Last Supper
It was the first day of Unleavened Bread. The woman came to knead. And she asked: "Where do we prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said, "Go to a certain person and tell him, 'The teacher says: 'Soon, I will celebrate the Door Holiday at your house with my students.'"
The disciples did as Jesus had told them. They were preparing the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
She was eating, he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."
The students were deeply saddened. One by one, they started telling him, "Not me, Sir, not me!"
Jesus answered, "He who has dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me."
The faithful son went his way, though it was not written for him. But what will become of him who is used as the faithful son? If only his death were only.
Yoda was the one who was going to send him. He said, "Not me, Master, right?" Jabba said, "Yes, you."
She was eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it and eat; this is my body."
So he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, and said, "Drink ye all of it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for the forgiveness of sins that are many.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
"You are on my paths and you are in the first mosque. Jesus says Peter will end up."
Yasoos said to them, "You will all flee from me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
"The others will leave you, but I will not."
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus replied. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times and say that you do not know me."
But Peter said, "I will die with you, but I will never say I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
So Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
"You are covering Peter and the two brothers with foam. You are breaking and exposing."
He said to them, "I am worn out; I am about to die. Stay here; remain with me, on guard."
This is simple, simple. Then this is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple, simple. This is simple.
So he went out to his kinsmen and to those in his mother's house, and they told him, "Where did you stay?" Peter asked, "How could you not stay with me for even an hour?"
Point and call. It fades from the steps as it is drawn. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Yesis changed again. He will pray: "Father, can this cup pass from me? Yet not what I will, but what You will."
So he turned and returned. He found them alive. He could not open their eyes.
He left and left again. He left for the third time on the same thing.
Then he turned to the people. He said to them, "Are you still devouring and wasting? Testify! The hour is near. The Son of Man is handed over to be crucified."
Grow up! We are not toys! Hey, hey, who are they using me to use! Jesus is being used.
As Jesus was speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. They were sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Yoda, who had been pointing out Jesus, simply gestured with them. "It is he whom I kiss," he said. "Seize him."
Juda went up to Yossel immediately. "Shalom, Rebbi!" he said, and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friends, do what you are told." Then the men moved in. They seized Jesus and arrested him.
In that instant, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
You think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how are books verified? They say they happen like this.
At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, "Do I lead a band of armed men against you? Why did you not arrest me when I was in the temple teaching? Then you would have made your arrest publicly."
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the teachers left and forgot about it. Jesus was brought before the Sanhedrin.
Those who protested against Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, the son-in-law of Annas. The teachers of the law and the elders gathered together.
Without delay, meet Jesus face to face. Just go down the path the narrator prepared. Go in among the onlookers and see what happens.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses accused. In the end, they accused two other witnesses.
They said, "This worker said, 'I can destroy the mosque of Allah. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the crowd rose up and asked Jesus, "Why do you answer them? What are these claims that these people are making about you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The judge said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus replied. "But I tell you that in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
So the priest removed her clothes. He said, "She has spoken evil against God! Do we need further testimony? I myself heard her utter this evil."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they replied.
So they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. They struck him on the head with their hands.
They said, "I adjure you by Christ, who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the garden. A serving woman called out to him, "You were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that he wasn't. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
So he went out to the gate that led to the courtyard. Another woman saw him and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
As he said again that it wasn't him. Then he said under oath, "I don't know the person!"
Then, they kept simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying and simplifying.
So Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are talking about!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Yoda bows to himself.
It was still early in the morning. All the people, including the children and the elders, decided to kill Jesus.
They attributed it to him and took him, then afterwards they regretted it, about the one who was hidden.
Yoda, who had sent him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. And he felt guilt and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
"I'm wrong," he said. "I've done a man a disservice." "We don't care," they replied. "That's your problem."
Juda used to leave money in the mosque and take some. Then he left and collapsed.
The gentlemen took the amulets. They said, "This is forbidden to be placed in the church's box. It is blood money. It is payment for a man's death."
She decided to use the money to buy a field for the cooks. People from other countries would be buried there.
This is why it is still called the Field of Blood today.
So the words that the prophet spoke to him became true. He said, "They took thirty pieces of silver, the price set by the people of Israel."
They used the metal to buy a field for the potter, as the Lord commanded me. (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is delivered for thirty pieces of silver.
Jesus was registered before the judge. The judge asked him, "Are you the King of the Muslims?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
But when the children and adults passed by to punish him, he did not respond.
So Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the accusation against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The judge was truly amazed.
It was the custom of the governor at Passover to release one prisoner. The people chose whom they wanted to release.
At that time they had a famous prisoner called Barabbas.
Then Pilate addressed them again, "Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?" They shouted back, "Crucify him!" "But what has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. "Crucify him!" they shouted. "Release Barabbas!"
By that, he knew that the leaders were accommodating. He knew that this was the reason they used him.
Bilhah was sitting on the judge's bench when his wife sent him a message, saying: "Do not interfere with this man, he is innocent. I have suffered great tribulations in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
"Which of Helen's suitors did he keep as his editor?" asked the judge. "Paris," they said.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all said, "Crucify him!"
"McKay? What's wrong?" asked Bellat. But they shouted louder, "Prepare!"
"He kept saying how he hadn't earned it. Rather, the group became more intense. So he took water and washed his hands of them. 'I was not in control of this man's death,' he said. 'You were in control of it!'"
All the people replied: "We and our children accept responsibility for what you have done!"
"He should not break the bars. Rather, he should rule with gentleness. Rather, he should rule with gentleness. Rather, he should rule with gentleness."
The soldiers who subdued the Muslim deserved to subdue his house, called the Praetorium. And all the soldiers gathered after him.
They removed their clothes and put on purple clothing on their leg.
They are blowing on them and forgetting them.
They are ganging up on him. They are hitting him on the head with a stick again and again.
Then they did not call him, they let him be, and restored his kingdom to him. Then they took him and handed him over to be crucified on a rock. Jesus is crucified on a rock.
As they left the city, they met a man from Cyrene. His name was Simon. They compelled him to carry the cross.
They arrived at a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
And they mixed the tea with expired powders and gave it to Isa to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
You have stood here before.
A notice was posted above his head, which read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
There were two used ones in the mosque. One on the right and one on the left.
Those who passed by derided Jesus, wagging their heads.
He said, "So you would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
As dedicated by the Muslim, the teacher, and the poems.
"He has caused harm to others," they said. "But he cannot even save himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. God always makes things easy for him when he wants. He is the one who said, "I am the son of God."
Likewise, the adults who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From sunrise until three, the earth was covered in darkness.
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Mark 15:34)
Some of those who were standing heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
Quickly someone decided and took a piece of cloth. He filled it with olive oil and placed it on a bandage. And offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone, let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
Then Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, died.
In an instant, the curtain opens from top to bottom. The ground trembles. The stones split open.
The tombs were opened. And many bodies of the middle class dead were turned.
She was coming out of the dead. After God raised Jesus, they went to the holy city. She appeared to many.
The Romans and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened. They were terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to help him.
Mary Magdalene was one of them. Mary the mother of James and Joses was with them. And the mother of Zebedee was there. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
He asked for tail and was given tail.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean sheet of nylon.
He laid it in his new sepulcher hewn out of the rock, and rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting near the tomb. The tomb guards.
The following day was the day after the preparation day. The sons and the horse went to the court.
"Sir," they said, "we know something the liar did not say while he was alive. He said, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So order the tomb to be guarded until the third day; otherwise, the disciple might come and steal the body, and then claim that Jesus has risen from the dead. This final lie will be worse than the first one.
"Bring some guards with you," replied Belat. "Go and secure the cemetery as best you can."
They used to take them and forget the bus. They imitated the stone and placed guards on duty.
Jesus rises from the dead.
It was Saturday. The sea was calm on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. Seek refuge in your Lord from the sky. Seek refuge in the House of the Most High. And descend to the House of the Most High. And descend to the House of the Most High. And descend to the House of the Most High.
His body shone like light. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were terrified of him, they would tremble and become as still as the dead.
The angels said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
Don't be that! Rise, as he said he would rise! Hurry up and look at the place where he used to be.
Go quickly! Tell Abadeh, "He has risen from the dead, and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him." Now I have told you.
The women hurried from the tomb. They were frightened, but they were also excited. They went to tell the students.
Jesus met them suddenly. "Peace!" he said. They came to him, took his hands, and bowed to him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
The women were walking, when some guards entered the city and informed the Babylonians of everything that had happened.
When the sons gathered with the saints, they agreed on a plan. They offered the army a large sum of money.
They told the army: "We want you to say: 'His children called at night. They hid his body and we slept.'"
If the governor hears this news, we'll pay him. This will keep you with me.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story spread among the Jews from day to day. Finally, Christ gave his orders to his students.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated before him. Yet some of them still held onto their questions.
So Jesus came to them. He said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Thus it is written, and thus it was fulfilled, that the Christ should suffer and rise from the dead on the third day and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And you can be sure that I am with you always, from the beginning to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
"I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way" (Malachi 3:1).
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
And John arrived. He baptized people in the wilderness. He called on people to repent and change from their sins. It is attributed to God that He will forgive you.
All the people from the countryside in Judea came at night. All the people from Jerusalem came later. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
Youn handed over a bundle of clothes from the camel's back. He had a belt of bread around his waist. He ate and was satisfied.
These are not called John. "After me, one will come who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. 'Jesus, who is baptized and tempted.'"
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up from the water. Suddenly he saw the heavens open. He saw the Holy Spirit come down on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Don't send the Holy Spirit Jesus to the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. The devil tempted him. He was not harmed by wild animals. The angels took care of him. Jesus invented the first teachers.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He proclaimed the good news from God.
"The time is fulfilled," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and take care of the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and his son Andrew. They were casting their net into the sea. They were fishermen.
"Work, be silent," said Jesus. "I will show you who is used to make humans."
Since they left their networks and joined him.
Then Jesus went a little further on, and saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in a boat mending their nets.
Quickly they left him. Their father Zebedee remained in the boat with the hired men. Then they followed Jesus. Jesus cast out an evil spirit.
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People understood from his way of teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He did not speak like religious scholars.
At that very moment, a man shouted in their mosque. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
"Where are you taking us, Jesus of Nazareth? Are you going to destroy us? I hear who you are. You are worthy before God!"
"Get thee behind me, Satan!" Jesus said with a sigh. "Get thee hence!"
The evil demon shook the man violently. Then it exited him with a loud noise.
Everyone understood. Some of them asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And a powerful method! Even giving orders to the demons, and they act on what is said."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and his companions left the altar and immediately set out with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother was lying in bed. She was sick. They told Jesus about her.
She went to her daughter, took her daughter's hand and helped her stand up, and her daughter's fever subsided, then she started to serve them.
In the evening, after sunset, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them.
All the people in town gathered at the gate.
Many of them were healed, sick with various diseases. And many demons were cast out. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was early in the morning, and still dark. Jesus got up and went out of the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends came to wait for Jesus.
When they found him, they cried: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Yassos replied, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns, and I have to invite them. That's why I brought you."
She was walking everywhere in Galilee. He was preaching in their synagogues. He was casting out demons. Jesus heals a sick man with leprosy.
A man with a skin disease was working to earn a living. He would prepare to work by prostrating himself. He said, "If it pleases you to make me clean, that would be enough for me."
Jesus was nervous. He held out a hand and touched the man. "I'm excited to do it," he said. "Be clean!"
The disease left him immediately. He returned healthy.
Jesus sent him immediately. And he gave him a strong warning.
"Don't tell this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Perform the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be proof to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to speak immediately. The news spread to all the people. So he could not enter the city openly. He remained outside the city in solitary places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Without you, always, just just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,
There were so many people together that there was no room. There was not even room outside the door. And Jesus called the people by the word.
Those who had reached four carried a man who could not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering the man on a mat, they set him before Jesus.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the law teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
How does this house speak? It says something evil! Only God can forgive!
Yasus immediately understood what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking this?"
Is it enough to say to him, 'Your sins are forgiven'? Or is it enough to say, 'Get up, take your bed and walk'?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then Jesus asked the man who couldn't walk.
"I tell you," he said, "be quiet. Shut up and stop it."
The man rose and took his mat, then went away and showed himself to everyone. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chose Levi.
Jesus again went around in the region of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd followed him, and he taught them.
He was followed by Leo, the son of Alphaeus. Leo was sitting at the tax office. "Follow me," Jesus said to him. Leo got up and followed him.
Without hesitation, Jesus was eating in the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large group that followed Jesus.
Some of the Pharisees were present. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So his disciples asked him, "Why does Jesus eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repent and follow me." Jesus is asked about evaluation.
The Pharisees and the scribes are without instruction. And there were things done that Jesus might not be noticed. And she said to him, "The Pharisees are devouring. And the scribes are devouring. But the Pharisees and the scribes are not devouring you. And did they have no reason?"
Jesus replied, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom takes them away; and then they will fast in that day.
People don't sew new clothes onto old clothes. If they did, the new part would separate from the old, resulting in greater damage.
People never get tired of something new in every generation. If they did, everything would break, everything would collapse, everything would fall apart. No, all people get tired of something new in every generation. Jesus is the King of the Sabbath day.
On a Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through wheatfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some of the wheat.
The Persians told Yas: "Take it! It is illegal to do this on September Feast. Why are your students doing it?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were in need of food. They were hungry."
It was a time when Abiathar served as the high priest. David entered the House of God and smiled at the holy bread. Only bishops were allowed to eat it. But David shared some with his soldiers.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
So the Son of Man is a king even to the day of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
And the first time spies entered the school, they were a man with a sick and troubled hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to trap Jesus in what he said. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the creature who extended his hand, "Drink in the midst of everyone," he said.
So Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or destroy them?" But they remained silent.
Jesus watched them with anger, disturbed because their hearts were hardened. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand," and he stretched out his hand, and his hand was restored as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus sent his disciples to the lake of Galilee, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him.
The people heard all that Jesus was doing. Many came to him, from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and from around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to get him a small boat. This would keep the people from crowding around him.
Jesus, why do we travel just to travel, just to travel, just to travel, just to travel, just to travel, just to travel, just to travel.
When the people saw the thunder and lightning, they fell prostrate and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve disciples.
Jesus sat on the mountain. And people came to him, and he taught them.
He gave them twelve, and he named them apostles, that they might be with him and that he might send them forth to preach. And he gave them power to cast out demons.
They will have authority to drive out demons.
Jesus appointed the twelve, and Simon was among them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
James, the son of Zebedee, and his sons John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
There were Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. Again a large crowd gathered, so large that Jesus and his disciples could not eat.
The family heard about it. They came down and withdrew from him. She said, "He is crazy."
Some of their scribes were present. They had come from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the power of the prince of demons, he drives out demons."
Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If the kingdom fights within itself, it collapses.
If the family is separated, it fades away.
