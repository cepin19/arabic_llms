첩rr is the most important person in the kingdom?
첌 that time, the Pharisees came to Jesus and asked, "Which one is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus claimed to be a small child and that he stood among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Anyone who welcomes a little child in my name welcomes me.
But what if someone were to lead one of these little ones who believe in me into sin? If that were to happen, it would be better for that person to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.
How much would the world have suffered because of the things that drive people to sin! Such things must come. But how much would it be for those who cause them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The story of the lost rabbit.
Make sure you do not neglect any one of these. That is what I am telling you. For their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Imagine a man has 100 cows and one runs away. Will he still have 99 cows on the mountains? Will he move and wait for the cow that ran away?
What I'm going to tell you is a fact. If this goat is found, it will feel more joy than 99 goats that didn't escape.
This thing applies to your Father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him over.
But what if he does not hear you? Then take one or two others with you. The book says, "A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell the church. And what if he refuses to listen to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What is closed on earth will be opened in heaven. What is opened on earth will be closed in heaven.
Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"If people gather with me, I am with them." The man who did not torment.
Peter turned to lead them. "Lord," he asked, "how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Seven times?"
Jesus replied, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to gather all that was due from his subjects.
Since the king started doing it, a man worth millions of dollars was introduced to him.
The man was unable to pay, so he was given an order to be sold. As a result, the man had to sell his wife, children, and all he possessed to pay off his debt.
The servant fell on his knees before him. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll pay everything back."
His owners felt grateful to him. They forgave him for what he had done and were pleased with him.
But then, the worker went out and found one of the other workers who had been giving him some dollars. He caught him and started to pressure him. "Give me back what you gave him!" he said.
The other server dropped on his leg. "Give me a moment," he asked him. "I'll pay you back."
But the first worker refused. So he went and put the man in prison until he paid back what was owed.
The other servants saw what happened. They were very disturbed. They went and told the owner everything that had happened.
So he called the first servant. "You wicked servant," he said, "I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
"You were not ashamed to greet the safe one as I was ashamed for you."
Due to the anger, its owner turned to the debtors, and he will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
So shall my heavenly Father also do to you, if you do not forgive each one his brother from your hearts.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. Heal them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female? (Genesis 1:27)"
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
"There are no longer two, but one. Therefore, let no one separate what God has joined together."
They asked, "So why did Moses command a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But from the beginning it was not so."
Here is what I say to you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is only allowed to divorce his wife if she has not been faithful to him.
Muslims told him, "If this is the state between husband and wife, it is better not to enter into marriage."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are called to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men cannot be born again because they were born thus. Some were made thus by people. Others were made thus for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living thus should do so. "Children were brought to Jesus"
Some people simplified children to use them as bait. They asked him to put his hands on the children and wait for them. But the teachers told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Permit the children to come to me; do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he moved on. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. And Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not harm. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I followed all those orders," the young man said. "What else is left for me to do?"
Jesus replied, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he departed sadly, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the Muslims heard this, they were greatly surprised. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Yesis looked at him and said, "Without man, this is possible, but with God, all things are possible."
Peter replied, "We've simplified everything to follow you! What reward do we get?"
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus said to them. "When all things are created, the Son of Man will be seated on his glorious throne. Then those who have followed me will be seated on twelve thrones. They will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left homes or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But whoever is first will be last, and whoever is last will be first.
The story of the workers in the field
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
I agree to pay them the regular wage for a day's work. Then send them to his farm.
At nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in their market doing nothing.
He told them, "You go and work at my house, and I will pay you what you deserve."
So they moved. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and repeated the same thing."
At five o'clock, he went out and found other people standing around him. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one bought from us," they answered. "He said to them, 'Go and work in my vineyard.'"
When night fell, the farmer spoke to the person in charge of the workers. He said, "Pay the workers their wages and tell them. Start with the ones you hired last, then move on to the first ones."
The workers who arrived around five o'clock have come. Each one received their regular daily wage.
So, when the first one hired came, they expected to get more. But each of them got the same daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining to the owner.
"The people who were bought secondly only worked for one hour," they said. "You pay them the same amount as us. We did most of the work and we were in the hot sun all day."
"Indeed," the patron replied to one of them, "I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for a regular daily wage?"
Take your salary and leave. I want to pay the same salary I gave to the one who neglected it before.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel deceived because I gave away easily to others?
So the last will be first, and the first last. Jesus speaks again of his death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he devised twelve disciples to discuss with.
"We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "There the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"They will hand him over to people called the Jews. People will mock him and beat him. They will crucify him. On the third day, he will be seen alive!" A mother asks Jesus for something.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus. Her sons accompanied her. She approached Him and asked Him for something.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant me that one of these two sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "I will drink from my cup. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or at my left; those places belong to those whom my Father has chosen."
The remaining ten heard this and were angry with the two sons.
He gathered them all and said, "You know your country's leaders. They rule over their people, and their leaders command them."
Do not be like this. Rather, anyone who wants to be important among you should be your servant.
And whoever you want to be your guardians, they must be his slaves.
Be like the godly person. He did not come to be served. Rather, he came to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to set free many people. Two disabled men are avoiding their livelihood.
Yasus and his disciples were leaving Geresao. A large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The crowd begged them to stop, asked them to be quiet, but the two men shouted even more: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and turned to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"God," they answered, "we want to see."
Yasi was deeply interested in their relationship. He touched their eyes. Suddenly, it became clear to them. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples ahead.
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a donkey tied up, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, say: "The master needs them, and I will send them to the kingdom immediately."
This happened so that what was heard from the prophet might be fulfilled. He said:
Say to Zion, "Behold, your king comes to you. He is humble and rides on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The students went and did what Jesus had told them.
They urged the horse and the colt. They threw their clothes on them. Then Jesus sat on the clothes.
A large group was waving on the road. Others were cutting trees and clearing them from the road.
Many people followed him, and others followed him. They all said, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. The people asked: "Who is this?"
The people answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was driven out of the synagogue.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written in the book that the Lord said, 'I will call my house a house of prayer for all people' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a den of thieves" (Jeremiah 7:11).
Blind and disabled people came to Jesus at the altar. And he healed them.
The bishops and the scholars saw the wonderful things he did. They saw the children in the church area shouting: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were envious.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus. "Haven't you ever read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
So Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fruit tree by the road. He approached the tree and found on it only leaves. Then he said to it, "Never bear fruit again!" Suddenly the tree withered.
When they saw this, they were shaken. "How did the fruit tree dry up so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done."
If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. A question of Jesus' authority.
Yusays entered a mosque. And while he was teaching, the leaders and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing this?" they asked. "Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you the context of what I am doing."
"Where did John's blessing come from? Did it come from heaven? Or did it come from people?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
But what if we say "of men"? We fear people. All people thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things." The story of the two sons.
What do you think about this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I'm not going," the son replied. But later he changed his mind and went.
So the father went to another son. He said the same thing to him. And the son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first son," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed and followed him. I saw that. But even that did not keep you from your sins and enjoyment. The story of the tax collectors.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned land and established a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He made a winepress. And he built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the time for storing approached, the man sent his workers to the people who bought lands. He asked the workers to gather his share of the fruit.
But the poor penetrated his workforce. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw rocks at the third to kill them.
So the owner went out and hired more workers, many more than the first time. He paid them all the same wage.
In the end, he sent his son to them. "They will respect my son," he said.
But the poor saw the son approaching. They said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit all the owner's property someday. Come on, let's kill him, and we will own everything."
So they took him and drove him out of the olive grove. Then they killed him.
When the olive owner returns, what will he do to those who employ him?
"These evil people will be destroyed," they replied. "Then the farm will be given to other tenants. And they will be given a share of the crop at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
So this is what I say to you. The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to those who bear fruit.
Whoever falls on that stone will be broken, but the stone will break whoever falls on it.
The bishops and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowds. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Yasi told them other events. He said:
Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent his servants to those who were invited to the feast, and told them to come. But they refused.
So he sent some of his servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and all is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people didn't care. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest were taken as laborers and treated them generously before killing them.
The king became very excited. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the criminals and burned their city.
So the king said to his servants, "The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the corners of the street and greet everyone you find.
So the workers went to the streets and gathered all the people they found, whether good or bad. And soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king came to see the guests and noticed a man who had been invited but was not wearing wedding clothes.
"Friends," he asked, "how did you get in here without a wedding suit?" The man couldn't say anything.
So the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him out into the darkness; there he will weep and gnash his teeth."
"You are often called, but rarely chosen." Can taxes be paid to Qais?
The Pharisees went away. And they held a council to entrap Jesus by His words.
"They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. 'Teacher,' they said, 'we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, and you don't play games with people's faith. Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?'"
Sure, what do you think? Should we pay taxes to a ruler or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trip me up?"
Show me the purse that people use to pay their taxes. They accused him of having a silver purse.
He asked them, "Whose image is this? And whose words?"
"Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished, forgot it, and went away. Marriage when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"The doctor," they said, "This is what we did not tell Moses. If a man dies without sons, his brother must marry the daughter. Sons must be born so that the brother's name may be carried on."
We had seven brothers. The first one died and had no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It even happened to the seventh brother.
In the end, the lady died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her.
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What have the dead risen? Have you not read what God has said to you?
He said, "I am the God who worked with Abraham. I am the God who worked with Isaac. And I am the God who worked with Jacob." (Exo 3:6) It is not the God of the dead who is believed in, but the God of the living.
When the people heard this, they increased in their love for what they had learned. The most important commands.
The Pharisees listened because the Sadducees were unable to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees came together.
One of them was a lawyer. Jesus asked him a question.
"Doctor," he asked, "What is the most important command in the law?"
Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and fundamental command.
The second is like it. "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Luke 19:18)
Everything in the Sharia and the messengers is based on these two commands. Who is Christ?
They gathered around the fire. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Whose Son is He?" "The Son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
God said to my Lord, "Take hold of My right hand, until I make your enemy your footstool." (Quran 110:1)
So if David calls him "Lord," how can he be his son?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him a question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Yasees spoke to the crowd and his students.
He said, "The scholars of the Law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
So, you must obey them, and do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do. Because they don't practice what they preach.
They strap weights and carry them on people's shoulders, but they don't want to lift anything to move them.
Everything he does, he does it for others to see. They put small boxes on their foreheads and tops containing verses from the Quran. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the branches on their clothes very long.
They love to sit in the place of honor at meals. They also love to get the most important places in the church.
They like to be summoned in the markets. They like to be called "Rabbi."
But you are not called "Lord," for you have one Master, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father. You have one Father, who is in heaven.
Do not call anyone "teacher," for you have one teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you will be your worship.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
How many times will you make people stumble, you teachers of the law and you Pharisees! Hypocrites! You lock the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, and you do not allow anyone else to enter.
(No
How frightening it was for you, O teachers of the law and Pharisees! You are hypocrites! You travel everywhere to win someone to your religion. Then you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are.
How inconsistent you Muslims are! You say, "If someone takes an oath in the name of the rightful Imam, it is not acceptable, but if someone takes an oath in the name of the rightful Imam's gold, it is acceptable."
You're exposed and stupid! What's more important? Is it gold? Or is it the church that makes gold sacred?
You also say: "If someone precious takes on the name of the altar, it means nothing, but if someone precious takes on the name of the offering mentioned on it, that is respected."
O blind one! What is more important? Is it the gift or the mass that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever speaks falsely by the name of the altar speaks falsely by his name and by everything on it.
And anyone who is honored by name in the user's name is honored by name in his name and in the user who lives in him.
And whoever lies in the name of heaven lies in the name of God's angel and what he keeps.
How much have you left to us, O teachers of the Law and you, prey! You are deniers! You give God ten of your feelings like saffron, dill, and cumin. But you have not done the consistent task of the Law, such as justice, mercy, and truth. You should have done the consistent without assuming the principle.
You are such hypocrites! You remove the tiny speck from your food, but you seize the beautiful one!
How frightening it must have been for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You are hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to gratify yourselves.
The disabled Sufi! Start by cleaning the inside of the cup and the plate first, then the outside becomes clean.
How frightening you are, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You are hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
This is the same with you. From the outside, you appear to be doing what is healthy. But on the inside, you are filled with the wrong thing. You put on a show of caring.
How frightening it was for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you would lie: "If we lived in the days of those who came before us, we would not have done what they did, we would not have contributed to the killing of the two messengers."
So you bear witness against yourselves, admitting that you are the children of those who killed the messengers.
So finish the sins that were started before you!
You are a two-faced usurper! How do you escape the wrath of God?
So I sent to you messengers, and scholars, and warners. You will honor some of them. You will honor some of them on your rooftops. You will honor others in your mosques. You will honor them from city to city.
"Therefore you shall pay for every drop of blood that has been shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zachariah, the son of Berechiah, whom I killed between the altar and the temple."
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
O Messenger! O Messenger! You kill the messengers and split the rocks to kill those sent to you. I often wanted to gather your people. I wanted to be like a hen gathering her chicks under her wings. But you didn't allow me!
You see, your house is left empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Chapter 118:26)
End of the world symptoms
Jesus left the altar. He had walked away when his servants came to draw his attention to the altar buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Yashua was sitting on Mount Olives. Then his disciples came to him in private and said, "Tell us," they said, "When will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the world?"
Jesus replied, "Drink and work carefully, so that no one deceives you."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am Christ!" and will lead many astray.
You will hear of wars. You will hear people talking about future wars. Don't worry. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
The state will compete with the state. Royalty will compete with royalty. People will lack food. Earthquakes will occur in many places.
All this is the beginning of labor pains.
People will hand you over to them, and they will kill you. Everyone will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people will turn away from their faith, they will hate each other, and they will hand some of their number over to their opponents.
Many false prophets will arise. Many people will be deceived.
As evil increases, people's love will grow cold.
But those who stay until the end will succeed.
This good news will be proclaimed to the queen throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "desolating abomination" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). You will see this abomination in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
For those in Yuda, they flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof is allowed to go down to his house and take anything.
No one in the field is allowed to go back and get their clothes.
How it will be in those days for pregnant women! How it will be for nursing mothers!
Oh God, let her not have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be severe difficulties in those days. They will be worse than at any time from the beginning until now. And there will be nothing like it again.
If it were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, it will be cut short.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
The false prophets and false messengers will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will seek to deceive the people chosen by God, if possible.
Look, I told you before.
So if anyone tells you, "It's far out in the desert," don't go there. Or if anyone tells you, "It's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
The light that comes from the east is seen in the west; the same will apply when the Son of Man comes.
Cows will gather wherever there is a dead body.
After the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the tribes of the earth will mourn. People will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send his chiefs with a great sword. He will gather his chosen people from all directions. And he will seat them from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fruit tree. When its thorns are combed and its leaves unfold, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all these things happening, you know the end is near. It's by the door.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. The people who were alive at that time will not die until all those things happen.
The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. The same thing will happen when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and lived, they arranged marriages, they gave their daughters in marriage, and they did all this until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the floods came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will move and the other will stay.
Two women will be in their power. One will be discouraged and the other will remain.
So remain vigilant. You do not know on which day your Lord will come.
You must understand something. Imagine that the homeowner knew the time of night the criminal would come. So he would stay and watch. He wouldn't allow him to enter the house.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Imagine a man who appoints one of his workers to manage the other workers in his house. The worker's job is to give them food at the right time. The master wants an honest and intelligent worker for this task.
It will be good for the servant if he finds the listener performing his duty when he returns.
What I'm going to tell you is a fact. This will put the burden on this worker for everything he owns.
But suppose the worker is bad. Suppose he says to himself: "What keeps a male owner away for a long time?"
Imagine that he starts beating up other workers, and imagine that he eats and stays with those who drink a lot.
The owner of this worker will return on a day the worker does not expect. He will come at a time the worker does not know.
So the barber will cut it into pieces. He will send it to the place where hairdressers go. We will be crying and gnashing our teeth.
A Story of Ten Muslims
Here is what the kingdom of heaven will do at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet their husband.
Five of them were stupid. Five were smart.
Those who were lamp-bearers took their lamps, but they took no olive oil.
The two men took olive oil in cups with their lights.
The wedding didn't come for a long time. So the bride got anxious and fell asleep.
At midnight someone shouted: "Here is your husband! Come and see him!"
So all the bridesmaids awoke and prepared their lights.
Those who were destitute said to those who were well-off, "Share some of your oil with us, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "It may not be enough for all of us. Go to those who sell oil and buy it for your families."
So she went to buy oil. But as they were walking, her husband arrived. The bride who was ready with him entered the wedding dinner. Then the door was closed.
Then came the other brides. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied: "What I am telling you is true. I don't know you."
So stay in touch. You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom comes. A tale of three workers.
Again, it will be like a kingdom of heaven. A man was going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one, $4,000 to another, and $2,000 to the third. The man gave each worker the amount he knew he could secure. Then he went on his trip.
The servant who received $10,000 started working immediately and invested his money. He made an additional $10,000.
The one who gained $4000 gained $4000 more.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his money there.
After a long time, the owner of the slaves returned and demanded that they collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 sent another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you've touched me with $10,000. See, I've gained an additional $10,000."
His master answered, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant! Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord!"
The man who had $4000 called. "Sir," he said, "I trusted you with $4000. Wait, I made an additional $4000."
His master answered, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant! Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord!"
Then came the man who received $2000. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a hard man, reaping what you did not sow, gathering crops you did not plant."
So you were afraid. You went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Be careful, this doesn't belong to you.
His owner replied, "You are a accuser and a accuser! Do you know that I am giving up what I have not prepared? Do you know that I am collecting what I have not prepared?"
Therefore, you should have put my money in the bank, and when I returned, I would get my money with an added amount.
So the other Omar ordered the persistent one: "Take the $2000 from him, and return it to the one who has $20,000."
Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. But as for those who do not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
Get this useless worker out of here. In the darkness, people will shout and gnash their teeth. "Cows and sheep"
The Son of Man will feed on all the earth's produce. All the angels will feed with him. Then he will sit on his throne of glory in the heavens.
He will gather all the people in front of him, and I will separate them into two groups, it will be like the shepherd who separates the sheep from the rabbits.
He will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Father has blessed you; come, take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.'
I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
I needed clothes, and you gave them to me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink.'
When we saw you as a stranger and invited you in? When we saw you in need of clothes and gave them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The king will answer: "What I tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of the least of these brothers, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me. I needed clothes. But you did not provide me. I was sick and in prison. But you did not assist me.
They will also say: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes, or sick or in prison and did not help you?"
He will answer, "What I tell you now is true. Anything you have not done for the least of these, you have not done for me."
So they will go away to be punished forever. But those who have done what is right will win eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus continued saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is just two days away. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
So the leading citizens came with the elders. They assembled in the building of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They made a plan to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might cause trouble with the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in two houses. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of costly perfume. She poured it on his head as he was eating.
When they saw this, they were enraged. "Why this loss?" they asked.
Olives could be sold at a high price. The money could be distributed to poor people.
Yashua knew this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
She poured the liquid over my body to transform me.
What I'm going to tell you is a fact. What you did will work anywhere this news is published around the world. It will work in mentioning it. Yoda agrees to deliver Jesus.
One of the twelve goes to the housekeepers. His name is Judas Iscariot.
He asked them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
Since then, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The meal of God's man.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He answered: "Go to a certain man and say to him, 'The teacher says: 'Soon my time will come, and I will celebrate the dedication of your house with my students.'"
So the disciple did as Jesus had told them. They prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The students became sad. Then they began to say to him one by one: "Not me, Lord, is it me?"
Jesus answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me."
The Son of Man goes according to what is written about him. But woe to him by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
Yoda was the one who was going to carry him. He said, "Not me, Master, is it?" And Jesus replied, "Yes, you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Eat this, for this is my body."
So he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, and said, "Drink ye all of it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I'm not drinking wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
So they sang softly and made their way to the Mountain of the Beloved. Jesus says that Peter will end up...
Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away from me tonight. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter answered: "Everyone else might leave because of you. But I will never leave."
"What I am telling you is true," Jesus replied. "This will happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I will die with you, but I will never say I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
So he said to them, "I am going up by the kerchief; I am in anguish until the death. Stay here, stay with me in caution."
He broadened a little. Then he fell on his face to the ground. And said, "Father, if possible, take this cup of suffering from me. But do what you want, not what I want."
So he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
Buy and claim. You will find in your transformation and attachment. The means are expansive. With bodily serenity.
Yasus moved again. He pleaded: "Father, is it possible to be excused from this cup? But if I must drink it, then let what you will happen."
So he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
For it widened and turned away again. And it widened a third time and it widened the same thing.
So he returned to the Muslims and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and feeling? Wake up! The hour is near. The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Stop! Surrender! This is what he uses on me to make them obey!" Yussuf is employed.
As Jesus was speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twenty. He had a large crowd with him. They were carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders had sent them.
Yoda, who was carrying Jesus, improved their mark. "The one I am approaching is the man," he said. "Stop him."
So he went to Jesus immediately and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friends, do what she has come to do." Then the men approached. They took Jesus and arrested him.
In that instant, one of Jesus' friends reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask for my father's help? He would immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how are books verified? They say they must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to seize me? Every day I sat in the temple courts and taught. And you did not arrest me."
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled. Jesus is brought before the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the elders had been assembled there.
With a distant touch, Peter followed Christ. He came to Christ's dwelling. He ended up and kept silent with the Muslims to see what would be.
The bishops and all the Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus. They wanted him to be killed.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Eventually, other witnesses emerged.
They said, "This worker said, 'I can destroy the mosque of Allah, and I am able to rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the elder son became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and pleaded with him, but he answered his father, "Look! All these
But Jesus remained silent. The judge said to him, "I adjure you by the Living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes, that is what you say," Jesus replied. "But I tell you all: In the coming days, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
So the witness took off her clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy against God! Why do we need additional witnesses? I heard him say this evil thing."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
So they struck his face. They hit him with their hands. Others hit him too.
They said, "We adjure you by Christ, who struck you?" And Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the garden. A serving woman called out to him, "You were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
So he went out to the gate that leads from the garden. And there they saw another woman. She said to the people, "This worker was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He again said that he wasn't there. Later, he said, "I don't know the man!"
After a few moments, the people who were about to leave for Petra moved on. "You're one of them," they said. "What you say gives you away."
So Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
So I reminded Peter what Jesus had said. "The rooster will crow," Jesus had told him. "Before it crows, you will deny three times that you know me." And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
Yoda hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided that Jesus should be killed.
They threw him while they were carrying him, and then gave him to his sons, who were in charge of the state.
Yoda, having seen that Jesus was condemned to death, felt deep shame and sorrow for what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I was wrong," he said. "I put a man away who didn't commit the crime." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Yoda threw the money into the church and departed. Then he went and collapsed.
The bishops took the bags of money. They said, "It is forbidden to put this money in the church's treasury. It is blood money. It is the price of a man's death."
They decided to use the money to buy a field for making the pot. People from other countries will be buried there.
This is why the broad field is still called the Field of Blood today.
So the words of the messenger sent by the Prophet proved true. He said, "They took thirty pieces of silver. This was the price set for them by the people of Israel."
They used the thirty pieces of silver to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me. (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is betrayed for thirty pieces of silver.
Jesus stood before the judge. The judge asked Jesus, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "Yes, it is as you say."
But when the sons and the elders came and attacked him, he did not respond.
So Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the accusation against you?"
But Jesus did not answer a single charge. The judge was truly amazed.
It was the Governor's Easter tradition to release one prisoner. People would choose who they wanted to be released.
At that time they had a famous prisoner called Barabbas.
So when the multitudes were gathered together, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas? or Jesus who is called Christ?"
By this, he knew that the chief priests were zealous. He knew that this was the reason they handed Jesus over to him.
While Judge Pilat was sitting on the bench, his wife sent him a message. She said: "Don't deal with this man. He is innocent. I have suffered great tribulation because of him in a dream today."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
"Which of these two do I want to release?" asked the judge. "Barabas," they answered.
"What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all said, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What did he do wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
He looked at them and knew he couldn't reach them. Instead, the people began to get restless. He took the water and washed his hands in front of them. "We are not responsible for this man's death," he said. "You are responsible!"
All the people said: "We and our children bear the responsibility of his death!"
But Barabbas was not; but Jesus, for a cause, was delivered up to be crucified. The sword goes out because of Jesus.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around him.
They removed his clothes and put a purple robe on his foot.
So they climbed up the trees, and they climbed up the trees, and they climbed up the trees, and they climbed up the trees, and they climbed up the trees, and they climbed up the trees, and they climbed up the trees...
They mocked him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his clothes on him. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified.
As they led him away, they made Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, carry his cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
And they mixed wine with burning powders and gave it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
You will fulfill and straighten it here.
The written accusation against him read, "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
There were two criminals with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by Jesus complained and mocked him, shaking their heads.
And he said, "So you will turn the altar and rebuild it in three days? Forget about me! Come down from the scaffold if you are the Son of God!"
Similarly, children, jurists, and old men laugh at them.
"He has delivered others," they said. "But he can't save himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. They could save him from God if they wanted to. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
Likewise, the criminals who were crucified with Jesus were mocking him. Jesus is dying.
From noon until three, the earth was covered in darkness.
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Mark 15:34)
Some of those who were there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
Quickly someone ran, took a piece of cloth, filled it with wine, put it on a rope, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone, let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
In an instant, the curtain in the sanctuary was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split apart.
Treasures were opened, and holy people who had died were raised to life.
They came out of the graves. After Jesus was raised, I went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
The Roman centurion and those who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified. They said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
At a distance, many women were watching. They followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joses, was there as well. Zebedee's wife was also present. Jesus is buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He became a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Bilat and asked for his body. Bilat asked that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and covered it with a piece of clean cloth.
He placed him in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. Then he put a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene came to the tomb again, and there, by the tomb, were the guards.
The next day was the day after the preparation day. The sons and the Persian went to Bilat.
"The master," they said, "reminds us of something the liar said when he died. He said, 'I will rise again in three days.'"
So give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.
"Bring some guards with you," replied Belat. "Go and make the cemetery as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone.
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath had ended. It was early on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. A king came down from your Lord from the heavens. He went to the grave. The chamber returned and sat on the chamber.
His body shone like a hammer. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were terrified of him as they trembled and fell dead.
The angels said to the women, "Do not be afraid, I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was killed by poison."
He is not here! He has risen, just as he said. Go and see the place where he was.
Go quickly! Tell Abada: "He has risen from the dead, and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him." Now I have told you.
So the women fled from the tomb. They were terrified but also filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Jesus called out to them, "Hello!" They came to him, took his hand, and surrendered to him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me there." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were going, some of the guards entered the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the sons met with the leaders, they agreed on a plan. They also provided the army with a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His children called at night. They hid his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the Muslim hears this report, we'll pay him. This prevents you from trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. The story spread among the Jews from day to day. Finally, Jesus gave his students their last orders.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated before him. Yet some of them still doubted.
So Jesus came to them. And he said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
So you must go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Inform them to obey everything I commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
"I will send my messengers before you, and they shall prepare the way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
And John arrived. He was baptizing people in the desert. He proclaimed that people were being baptized and turning away from their sins. Then they would be forgiven by God.
All the people from the countryside in Judea welcomed me. And all the people from Jerusalem welcomed me. And when they admitted that they had surrendered, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw clothes made of camel fur. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate insects and bees outside the farms.
This is what John was calling for. "After me, one stronger than I will come. I cannot bow my head and untie his sandals."
I will cleanse you with hyssop, but he will purify you with the Holy Spirit. Jesus cleanses and sanctifies.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Yasoos was coming up out of the water. And suddenly he saw the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of the Holy One descending upon himself like a dove.
A voice from heaven said to him, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
The Spirit immediately sent Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. His satin clung to him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels embraced him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The Kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe the good news!"
One day he was walking by the side of Lake Galilee. He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting the net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"I appoint you, follow Me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Since they followed him, they followed him and forgot their nets.
So Jesus walked on a little further. There he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending their nets.
Quickly they called them. And they took their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants. Then they followed Jesus. Jesus casts out a bad spirit.
Jesus and his relatives went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he went to the synagogue and began to teach there.
People were surprised by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He didn't speak like the law teachers.
In a moment, a man shouted in their church. He was possessed by a demon. He said:
"Where are you taking us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I hear who you are. You are the Son of God!"
"Stop!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil demon shook the man violently. Then it exited him with a loud noise.
All the people were amazed, and they asked one another, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! He even gives orders to demons, and they obey him!"
The news about Jesus spread rapidly throughout all of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and his relatives left the synagogue, and immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
His aunt, his sister, was sleeping on the bed. She was sick. They told Jesus about her.
So he rushed to her, took her hand, and helped her up. Her temperature changed. Then she began to heal the wounded.
In the evening, after sunset, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus, and all who were possessed with demons.
All the people in town gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many who were sick with every kind of disease. He also cast out many demons, but he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a place apart.
It was early in the morning, and it was still dark. Jesus got up and went out of the house. He went to a place where He could be alone. There He prayed.
Simon and his friends went to wait for Jesus.
When they found him, they cried: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns so that I can proclaim the message there as well. That is why I have come."
So he traveled throughout Galilee. And he preached in their synagogues. And he took breath. Jesus heals a man sick with leprosy.
One of the untouchable lepers called out to Jesus. And Jesus, moved with compassion, said, "If you can believe, all things are possible."
Yashos was tense. He extended his hand and touched the man. "I'm compelled to do it," he said. "Get clean!"
The disease left him immediately. He returned healthy.
Jesus sent him away immediately. And he gave him a stern warning.
"Do not say this to anyone who is esteemed," he said. "Go and appear before the Lord. Perform the rite of purification that Moses commanded. This will serve as a sign to the Lord and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and started talking immediately. The news spread to all the people. So it was not possible for Jesus to enter cities openly. He remained outside cities in solitary places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum. When the people heard that he had returned home, they gathered to see him.
The crowd was so large that there was no room left. There was not even space outside the door. Jesus called the people to him.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing the tiles, they lowered the man on his mat.
Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."
Some of my law teachers sat there. They were thinking.
Why is this house talking like this? It's saying something bad! Only God forgives sins!
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "You were mistaken," or to say, "Get up, take your bed and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
"I say to you," he said, "get up, take your bed and go to your house."
The man rose and took his mat, and went away, while everyone was watching him. All the people were amazed, and they glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chose Levi.
Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Joseph, the son of Alpheus. Joseph was sitting at the tax office. "Follow me," Jesus said to him. Joseph stood up and followed him.
After that, Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and those called "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large group that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So his disciples asked him: "Why does Jesus eat with tax collectors and "sinners"?"
Jesus heard this, and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about cessation.

On a Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through wheatfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some of the wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing this?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
It was the time of the death of Abiathar the high priest. David entered the house of God and took away the showbread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. And David gave some to his companions.

Healing on Saturday
Again, spies entered the school. There was a man with a weak and twisted hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Yassees spoke about the man who only suffers from a weak and bent hand. "He ran ahead of everyone," he said.
So Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or destroy them?" But they remained silent.
He looked at them angrily, moved that their hearts were attached. Then he said to the creature, "Take out your hand," and she took it out, and her hand became like new.

Jesus moved with his disciples to the Lake of Galilee. And a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him, from Judea, from Jerusalem, and from all the regions of Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and from the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would keep the people from crowding around him.

Judas Iscariot was one of them. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. Again a large crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not eat.
