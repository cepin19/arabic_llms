Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram, and Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Structurally, Manasseh's father was Hezekiah, Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brother. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to leave for Babylon.
Then the family continued. Jehonathan was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerrubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achimaas. Achimaas was the father of Eliphelet.
Eliud was the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar was the father of Matthan, and Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abram to David, fourteen generations from David to the deportation to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah. The Messiah, Jesus Christ, was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Yoshio, was a devout man. He didn't want to publicly deceive her. So he planned to divorce her secretly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
He will beget a son. You shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled.
The girl will bear a child. She will give birth to a son, and he will be called Emmanuel, which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph awoke and did as the angels of God commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
But he still did not love her, even after she gave birth to a child. And Joseph named him Jesus.
Wise men visit Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the ruler over the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to pay him homage."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Therefore Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.
"In Bethlehem, in the manger," they answered. "That is what the messenger wrote. He said:"
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
So he informed his magi friends in secret. And he learned from them the exact time of the star's appearance.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. When you find him, inform me. Then I will also go and worship him."
After the wise men had heard the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men came to the house. They saw the child with his mother Mary. They greeted him and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God sent them a dream not to return to Herod, so they returned to their homeland by a different route. Joseph's family fled to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph awoke. During the night, he fled with the child and his mother Mary from Egypt.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. So was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the male children were taken from him. He was very angry and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and its surroundings. All children under the age of two were killed. This was in accordance with the time when the wise men saw the star.
Thus the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said:
A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are gone. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Christ returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was living in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The narrator said, "Wake up! Take the child and his mother, and flee to the land of Israel. For whoever tries to kill will be killed."
So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea, and that he ruled in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph fear to go there. And Joseph was warned in a dream, so he returned to the land of Galilee.
And he settled there in a town called Nazareth. So shall it be, as it is written about Jesus, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of donkey fur. He had a leather chain around his waist. His food was grubs and outer honeybees.
The people came out of Jerusalem and all Judea, and from all the region around the Jordan.
When they admitted they had surrendered, John patted them on the back.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Produce fruit that shows you have turned from your sin.
Do not think that you are saying to yourselves, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, even stones could be turned into children of Abraham.
The axe is ready to strike the roots of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, and I call you to repent of your sins. But after me will come a man who is mightier than I. And I am not fit to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
He hands it over to him to clean the barley from the threshing floor. He will gather its grains into the storehouse. But he will burn the grains with an unquenchable fire. "Jesus cleanses"
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
But Johannes tried to stop him, saying to Jesua, "I need to be cleansed by you, so why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
When Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is being drawn.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, and he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of not eating, Jesus was famished.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, turn these stones into bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are sons of your Lord," he said, "then come down. It is written: 'Your Lord will command that they submit their selves to Him, and they will be raised up by their own hands, and we will say, "Seize a stone!"' " (Surah 91:11, 12)
Jesus answered him, saying, "It is also written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.' " (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you bow down and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Matthew 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and behold, angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was thrown into prison. When Jesus heard this, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, which was by the Sea of Galilee in the region of Zebulun and Naphali.
Thus, what the prophet Joshua said came true. He said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the non-Jewish people live! Land on the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!
The people who now live in darkness will see a great light. They live now in a very dark land. But a light will shine upon them. (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
"I will make you fishers of men," said Jesus.
They cast out their nets immediately and followed him.
And soon he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
They immediately left the boat with their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
People told about him throughout Syria. And they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain, some were possessed by demons, some were violently shaking, and some were completely paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed him, including people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, and Judea, as well as from the other side of the Jordan.
Jesus gives the wishes.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up a mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
The hearing that is due is for those who work for the worthy life. The King of the Heavens belongs to them.
The level heavens are equal in death.
"The blessed ear is for those who were not proud. They will be given the land of the heavens."
"Hearing is for those who love and fear the good. So they will be blessed."
Peace be upon the righteous. Peace will be brought.
Peace be upon those whose hearts are purified. They will see God.
"Let your hearing be to those who teach peace, and they will be called the children of God."
"Blessed are those who suffer persecution because they do what is right, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
You are blessed when people mock you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in Heaven is great. Likewise, people harmed the messengers who lived in the past. Salt and light
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
People don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl. They put it on its level, and then everything in the house is lit.
Similarly, let your light shine before others. They will see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the law its full meaning.
Do not think that I have come to abolish what is in the law or in the prophets. I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before even one letter of the Law disappears. Not a single detail from the pen's manuscripts of the Law will vanish until all things are accomplished.
Do not break any of the least of these commandments, and do not teach others to break them. For if you do, you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep and teach these commandments, you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Here is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Amen.
You have heard what he said to those who lived long ago. He said to them, "You shall not kill." (Brothers 20:13) For whoever kills, shall be punished for it.
But this I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Start by presenting your gift in the aisle, then remember that your brother has something against you.
Keep your gift in front of the boards. Go first and join your brother and distract him. Then come back and present your gift.
If someone makes a claim against you and sues you in court, do it quickly. Work on it while you are with him on his way. If you don't, the judge may rule against you, then the official, and you may be detained in prison.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Commitment.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one of your hands than to have your whole body go into hell. Divorce.
He said, "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I tell you: whoever divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman causes her to commit adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him. Faith
Again I hear what was long ago proclaimed of your people: "Do not break the promises you made to God, and keep the vows you have made to him."
But here is what I tell you: Never make any such promises at all. Don't make them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make them in the name of Earth. That is the bed for God's foot. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city owned by the great King.
Do not be satisfied with learning only the names of things. Your days and nights are not enough for that.
"Yes" means yes, and "no" means no. Anything beyond that is from the devil. Be merciful to the brothers.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Matthew 21:24; Luke 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
If anyone takes you to court and wants your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
If someone forces you to walk a mile, walk two miles with them.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not deny him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that he said, "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Luke 19:18), "and hate your enemy."
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"So you will be children of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain to the righteous and to the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
If you only give to your relatives, what more are you doing than others? Even those who are considered unbelievers do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Being kind to those in need
Work carefully and do not do "righteous deeds" in front of people. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father who is in heaven will reward you.
When you give to those in need, let it be proclaimed with the sword of the Muslim. Do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They declare their deeds in churches and on the streets. They want to be respected by others. What I am about to tell you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
When you give to those in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Your charity will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
When you pray, do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners. They want to be seen by others. What I am telling you now is the truth. They have received their full reward.
When you pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Do not be like them. Your Lord knows what you need before you ask Him.
"This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.'"
Perhaps your kingdom will come. Perhaps what you desire to happen on earth will happen as it does in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
Keep us from harm as we are led, and protect us from evil.
Prepare for the things that you permit in your affairs. And if you permit things in your affairs, then it will not be permitted for you, O you who believe in Allah and the Last Day.
But if you do not forgive people their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. Fasting
When you go without eating, you don't look as mournful as those who merely pretend to be pious. They put on sad faces. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I'm telling you is true. They've received the full reward.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
For they do not know that you are paying. Only your Father, who cannot be seen, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up your treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart will be where your money is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes are weak. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. And if the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. One will be despised and the other revered. Or one will be honored and the other despised. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds in the sky. They do not sow or reap, nor do they gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And when you dwell in the land, do not follow in the footsteps of the evil ones. Observe how they grew from the forbidden flower. Do not be led astray by their actions or be influenced by their ways.
But I tell you that not even Solomon, in all his glory, was clothed like one of these flowers.
If this is what God clothes the grass of the field with, why will He not clothe you much better? After all, the grass is here today, and tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. And how little is your faith!
So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who are in unwarranted worship want all those things. And the Father in heaven knows you need them.
But make God's kingdom your top priority—mat his will be done in your life. Then you will also receive all these things.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when passing judgment on others.
Do not judge people, lest you judge yourselves.
They will judge you as you judge others. They will measure you as you measure others.
You see the splinter in your friend's eye, but you do not notice the splinter in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend: "I'll remove a piece of wood ash from your eye," when there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will be answered. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
If your son asks for bread, which one of you will give him a stone?
Or suppose he asks for fish. Who among you would give him a turtle?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
In all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. The great and the small gate.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction and fire. Many will go that way.
But the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find this way. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You can tell if they're genuine by what they do. "Do people pluck leaves from trees? Do they pick fruits from love?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can distinguish every tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
On that day, they will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
Then I will clearly tell them: "I do not know you, stay away from me, whoever does good!" The wise builders and those built by abortion.
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It rains. The waters rise. The winds blow and breathe upon this house. But it does not fall. It is built upon the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built his house on the sand.
The rain falls. The water rises. The winds blow and breathe upon this house. Then it collapses with a great explosion.
Jesus finished saying all these things, and the people were amazed at his teaching.
He delivered the lessons in a manner of one who has authority. He did not speak like their law teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the man was cleansed of his skin disease.
So Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached Him and asked for help.
"My servant," he said, "is suffering at home and cannot move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I am a man who is restored to himself. He has soldiers who obey my commands. I say to one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another, "Be crowned," and he is crowned. I say to my slaves, "Do this," and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he smiled. He said to those following him, "What I tell you is true. In Israel, I have not found anyone with such strong faith."
I tell you that many people will come from the east and the west, and they will be welcomed at the Queen's feast in heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be cast out into the darkness, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
So Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and it will be done for you as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to the house of Peter, he saw Peter's wife. She was lying in bed, and she was sick with a fever.
Jesus took her by the hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken: "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4) The commitment to bear our sins.
Seeing the crowd, Jesus instructed his disciples to go to the other side of Lake Galilee.
Then a lawyer came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
A disciple said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat, and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly a great storm arose on the lake. The waves crashed against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The Muslims have made death as their choice, and you deserve death by death.
He answered, "O you of little faith! Why are you afraid?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became a great calm.
The people were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the rivers obey him!" Jesus heals a man possessed by demons.
Jesus went to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadarenes. And two men who were possessed by demons met him, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they asked. "Have you come to punish us before our time?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was eating.
They begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us to the pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who had been possessed by the demons were healed and went to their homes, telling everyone what had happened to them and how it had been done through Jesus.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat and went to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his town.
Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the law professors said to their associates: "This man is saying something very bad!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are covered," or to say, "Rise and look"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the man who could not walk, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your house."
The man got up and went home.
When the people saw this, they were amazed, and praised God for giving man such power. Jesus chooses Matthew.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus dined at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and those called "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."
Go and learn what it means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repent and follow me. A contemplation on Jesus' teaching.
One day, the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often and pray, but your disciples do not fast. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People do not patch new cloth onto old clothes. The new patch will shrink away from the old, causing the tear to widen.
"New wine is not put into old bottles; otherwise, the bottles will break, the wine will be spilled, and the bottles will be ruined. No, new wine is put into new bottles, and both are preserved." "A dead girl and a sick woman"
As Jesus was saying these things, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus awoke and went with him, and so did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years, and she touched the hem of his garment.
I thought: "I just need to touch his clothes, and then I'll be healed."
Jesus saw her and said, "Daughter, your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that hour.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the mourners playing on the flutes, and he also saw the large crowds.
He said, "Go, the girl is not dead, she is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus was leaving, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They replied, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your faith has healed you."
They could see again. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that region.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the mare said, "Demons are driven out by the power of the king of demons." There are only a few workers.
Jesus sent out to all the towns and villages, taught in their mosques, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God, and healed every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
So Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
So ask the owner of the olive trees to send workers to his field.
Jesus sends the 12 messengers.
Jesus sent out twenty disciples with authority to cast out evil spirits and heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Those who follow are Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector. They belong to James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
The others are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go to any Gentile or Samaritan town.
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like a lost spot.
When you walk, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Submit to those who live, and save those who are dead, and save those who are far away in the language of the language, and drive out the jinn. You are worthy of the place, so you are worthy of the place.
Do not take any gold, copper, or metal in your belt.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, shoes, or walking gear. The worker should be provided with what they need.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone who wants to host you. Stay in their home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet the people living there.
If I receive you in this house, give it the mercy of peace. If I do not receive you, do not give it mercy.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, then turn on your heels and walk out of that house or city.
What I am going to tell you is the truth. On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for the capital of that city.
I send you forth as sheep among wolves; so be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
You are in danger! They will bring you before the local courts. They will beat you in their synod.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you'll do or how you'll do it. At that time you'll get the right words to say.
It will not be you who speaks. The Spirit will speak through you.
Brothers will give up their brothers to be killed. Fathers will give up their sons. Sons will rise up against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will hate because of me. But those who remain steadfast to the end will be saved.
When people are attacked somewhere, flee to another place. What I am telling you is true. Your journey through the cities of Israel will not end before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. And the slave is not better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. So if the master of the house is called Beelzebub, what can those who live there expect?
Therefore do not fear your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be revealed. Everything that is secret will be made known.
What is told to you in the night, interpret in the day. What is whispered in your ear, do it on the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.
What about those who say in front of people that they teach me? I will also say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I know him.
But what about those who say in front of people that they don't know me? I will say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers. Daughters will rebel against the ways of their mothers. I will be the rebellious daughters against their mothers.
A man's foes are they of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves his father or guardian more than me has no value to me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me has no value to me.
"He who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. And if anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
If a person approaches a prophet as a prophet, he will receive the worship of a prophet. And if a person approaches a lover of God as a lover of God, he will receive the worship of a lover of God.
If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to a child of mine, I will surely tell you the truth. They will certainly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Evangelist
Jesus continued teaching twenty Muslims. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Jesus asked them, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go to John and tell him what you hear and see."
Those who are blind are given sight. Those who have disabilities walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. Those who are deaf are made to hear. Those who have died are brought back to life. And the poor among the believers are made easy.
Peace be upon those whose faith has not been made lawful to violate.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did I go for? A man in fine clothes? No. People in fine clothes are in the King's schools.
So what did I go as? A prophet? Yes, I'll tell you, and perhaps more than a prophet.
It is he who was spoken of by the prophet Malachi: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Never has there been born a greater person than John the Baptist. But the least important person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you wish to accept him, John is the Elias who was supposed to come.
Whoever listens, let them listen.
To what can people today be compared? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to others. They say:
"We played the flute for them, but you did not see. And we composed for you a poem to be performed continuously, but you were not sorrowful."
When John came, he did not eat or drink as you do. People criticized: "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Wisdom is justified by her children. "Woe to you, cities that do not repent, for if the mighty deeds done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
Jesus began to speak of the cities where most of his miracles had been done. The people there did not repent. He said:
"How much more tolerable it would have been for you, Korazin! How much more tolerable it would have been for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, it will be easier for Tyr and Sedon than for you.
And are you not the servant of Karnum? Will you ascend to heaven? No! You will descend to the place of death. If the beauties bestowed upon Karnum were bestowed upon Sodom, they would not be beneath the earth until the Day of Doom.
But I tell you this: It will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
The father gave me everything. The father is the only one who teaches the son. The only ones who teach a father are the son and those whom the son has chosen to teach.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
They became my worshippers and learned from me. I am marked by gentleness, and I possess no pride. You will find solace for your spirits.
I fall asleep easily, and my burden is light.
Jesus reigned on the Sabbath day.
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through fields of grain. His disciples were hungry. So they began to pluck and eat some of the grain.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath, but your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was in need and he and his men were hungry?"
Therefore he entered into the house of God, and ate the hallowed bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for his companions, but only for the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It tells them that on every holiday, the men in the mosque must perform their duties that day. But they are not considered guilty.
I say to you, whoever is greater than the deity is here.
The writings say, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not be bringing charges against those who are not guilty.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
Then Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and distorted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus, so they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of you had a sheep and it fell into a pit on the Sabbath, would you not take hold of it and lift it out?
Man is valued more than sheep! That is what the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the chief priests plotted how they might kill Jesus. The servant of God, the chosen one.
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. He left that place and was followed by a large crowd, and he healed all who were sick among them.
But they were not to tell anyone who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen; he is the one I love and in whom I delight. I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations. They will proclaim my righteousness to the ends of the earth.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
It will not break a bruised reed, nor quench a smoldering wick, but will faithfully bring forth justice.
People will put their hope in him. (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him, and he was able to see and speak.
Everyone was amazed, and they asked, "Could this be the Son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what the people were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined. Every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out his devil, he is fighting himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say you cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your family cast them out? So then, your family will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or consider this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take his possessions? You must first imprison this man, then you can rob his house.
He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the believers with me, but scatters them, is against me.
So, this is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But the evil things spoken against the Spirit of God will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
You are the dispensers of a warning woe! How can you, who are bitter, say anything good? You say what is in your hearts.
A good person says good things, and these things come from the good stored inside them. A bad person says bad things, and these things come from the evil stored inside them.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
In your words, you will find either a punisher or a deserving one. "The mark of John
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
It is suggested that Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will stand in the day of judgment with the people who are now living. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned from their errors when Jonah came to them. And then, someone more important than Jonah came.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It passes through dry places, looking for a place where it can settle, but it does not find one.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the devil goes out, and brings with him seven other devils more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation." - "The Mother of Jesus and His Brothers"
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds, his father and sons stood outside, wanting to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brother are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
Anyone who does what my parents in heaven want is a brother or sister or mother to me.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
She gathered all the groups around him. Then he took some of the belly, and dwelt in it. And all the people ascended on the shore.
Then he told them many things in parables, saying, "A man went out to sow his seed."
He threw the sword on the ground. Some of it was on the path. Birds came and ate it.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants appeared quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it ignited the plants, and they withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the weeds. The weeds grew and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop that was a hundred, sixty, or thirty times as much as had been sown.
Whoever listens, let them listen.
The Muslims came to him and asked, "Why do you use stories when you speak to people?"
He replied, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. It has not been given to anyone outside of it."
Anyone who possesses this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have plenty. As for those who do not possess this kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken away.
Here's the reason I use stories when I talk to people. I say: "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the word of the prophet Joshua, who said, "You will hear but not understand. You will see but not know what you are seeing."
"Their hearts have become callous, they hear with their ears but do not listen, they look with their eyes but do not see. They do not understand with their hearts, nor do they turn to the Lord and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Many messengers and righteous people wished to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wished to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom, but they do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that is sown on the path.
The seed that fell on the rocky places was taken. These are the ones who hear the message and accept it with joy immediately.
But they have no roots. Therefore they endure only for a short while. They quickly fall away from the faith when difficulties or persecutions come because of the message.
Their seeds, which they had sown among thorns, were choked. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the message is crowded out by life's worries and the false promises of wealth. They are spoken about in terms of what they produce.
But others received seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it, and they produce a harvest that is one hundred, sixty, or thirty times as much as the farmers reaped. "The Parable of the Soils"
Jesus told the people another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy put poison between the grains, and then left.
The grains began to grow and form kernels. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The worshippers of money came to his feet and said, "Sir, did no good seed fall in your field? Then where did these lush plants come from?"
"An enemy did this," he said. And the slaves asked him, "Do you need us to retrieve the winds?"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat with the weeds."
Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the grain and send it to my barn. "The Parable of the Weeds and the Wheat"
Jesus told the people another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took a mustard seed and planted it in his field."
It's the smallest of the seeds you plant, but when it grows, it becomes the largest of the garden plants. It becomes a tree, and birds come to rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it spread through all the dough."
Jesus began to speak to the crowds in parables. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed."
So the words of the Messenger became true. He said, "I will open my mouth and utter dark sayings; I will declare things that have been kept secret since the creation of the world." (Verse 78:2 of Surah Al-Baqarah) Jesus interprets the story of the fig tree.
So Jesus sent the multitudes away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
He answered, "It is the son of man who sows the seed of good."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. And the weeds represent the people who belong to evil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. Their harvest is the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The bush was pulled and rubbed in the fire. So it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will be thrown into a blazing fire. And the people will weep and regret their decision.
"For the citizens of God's kingdom will shine like the earth in their Father's realm. Whoever has ears, let them hear. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl."
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a fine pearl.
Find one of great value. So he went and sold all he had and bought this treasure. The parable of the net
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake and gathered all kinds of fish.
When the net was full, they pulled it to the shore, then sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets, but they threw away the bad fish.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come and separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing fire, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old ones." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories, and then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And he began to teach the people in their synagogue. And they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Is this the son of the elderly man? Is his mother's name Mary? Are his brothers Jesus, John, Simon, and Jude?
Were not all his sisters with us? How then did this man come to have all these things?
They were offended at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He performed a few miracles there because they did not believe.
John the Baptist's head is severed.
At that time Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Prophet. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to perform such miracles."
Herod arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
John told Herod, "It is against the law for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John was a prophet.
At the feast of Herod, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests, and Herod was excessively pleased.
Therefore he swore to her with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.
Her sister told her what to say, and the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The queen was very sad. But he remembered the promises he had made and the dinner guests. So he ordered one of his servants to give her what she asked for.
John's head was taken in the prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and presented to the girl, who then took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went to a quiet place in a boat. The people heard about it, and followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. And he healed their sick.
As darkness approached, the Muslims came to him and said, "There is nothing here, it is evening time, send the people away, they can go to the villages and buy food."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
"We only have five pieces of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them to me here," he said.
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and gave thanks. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate, and their happiness ended. The Muslims collected twenty cans of the leftovers.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them, he went to a solitary mountain to answer the prayer. When night came, he was there alone.
The boat was already too far from the shore. It was being battered by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus went out to his disciples. He was walking on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were disturbed. "It's a ghost!" they said, and started screaming in fear.
Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, "Take heart! I am here. Do not be afraid."
"Master, art thou?" asked Peter. "If it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. Then Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. And he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
In a moment, Jesus seized his hand and held him. He said, "You of little faith!" "Why did you doubt me?"
When they entered the passenger, the wind stopped.
Then they were filled with fear and said, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"
They crossed the lake and reached Gensarat.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus, so they sent a message throughout the surrounding region. And people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow those who were sick to touch only the edge of his garment, and everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked:
Why don't your followers obey what the elders teach? Your followers don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commands of God? You prefer your traditions!"
God said: "Love your father and mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said: "If anyone curses his father or mother, he is to be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to say to their relatives: "Any help they have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
So they do not need to honor their parents by their merit. You waste the words of God by following what you have been taught.
"You are the deniers! Isaiah was truthful when he warned you. He said:
They love me for what they say, but their hearts are far from me.
I care not for their worship, but for the rules of humanity they teach. (Isaac 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand."
It's not what you put into your mouth that defiles you; it's what comes out of your mouth that does.
Then the Muslims came to him and asked him, "Do you know that the Quraysh protested when they heard that?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father has not planted in heaven. They will be uprooted."
Leave them. For the Pharisees are blind guides. Whoever follows whom will only care for themselves.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see that everything that goes into the mouth ends up in the stomach and then exits the body?
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.
Evil thoughts come from the heart, as do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins, as well as theft, bearing false witness, and lying about others.
These are the things that make you unclean. But eating without washing your hands does not make you unclean. "A Canaanite woman"
Jesus departed from Galilee and came to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A nation from Canaan lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! Her daughter is possessed by a demon. She suffers greatly."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded, "Send her away, for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the lady fell on her knees before him and said, "My Lord! Help me!"
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus departed from there. He walked by the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up into a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those unable to walk, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
Amaze the people. For those who could not speak began to speak. And the disabled were rehabilitated. And those who could not walk began to walk. And those who were visually impaired began to see. So the people gave thanks to God, who is called Israel.
So Jesus took his servant and commanded them to listen. He said, "These people deserve my help. They have been with me for three days now, and they have had nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they will collapse on the way home."
His worshipers answered him, "There is nothing here," and said, "Where can we get enough bread to satisfy this great multitude?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few fish."
Jesus sent the people to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate, and their happiness ended. Then the survivors invented seven balls from the remains.
The number of men who ate was 4000, and the women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky and say, 'The weather will be good, the sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "It will be rainy today, the skies are red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the skies, but you do not understand the signs that are happening now.
Evil and wicked people argue for a blessed flag. If they were given a flag, it would only be the flag of Jonah. Jesus descended from them and departed. The flag of the faction and the Sadducees.
They were ferried across the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The Muslims talked among themselves and said, "He must say this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were discussing. He said, "You have such little faith! Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five paintings for five thousand? Don't you remember how many plates you delivered?
Do you not remember the seven dishes that were for 4000? Do you not remember how many cups you made?
How can you not understand? I did not speak to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
Then the Muslims understood that Jesus had not told them to pay attention to the dough used in bread. Rather, he was reminding them of the warning against the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said, "Jesus is the Messiah."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. And he asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what about you? he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
Here is what I tell you. You are Peter. I will build my church on this rock, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus permitted his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks of his coming and his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, where he will suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He must be killed, and on the third day be raised again.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "No, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it if a person gains the whole world but loses their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father, with His angels; and then He will reward each according to his works.
What I am telling you is the truth. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Changes the appearance of Jesus.
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And his appearance was transformed before them. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. They were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was speaking, a luminous cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the Muslims heard this, they were shaken and fell on their faces.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw only Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man what they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
The teachers asked them: "Why do teachers say that Elijah should be sent first?"
Jesus replied, "Yes, Elijah must come first and make everything new again."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the Jews understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who was possessed by a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man ran up to Jesus, knelt down before him, and begged him.
"The lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He is convulsing and suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your servants, but they were not healed.
"It is you who do not believe and you who are evil!" Jesus replied. "How much longer must I remain with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring this boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to leave the boy, and it departed from him. He was healed instantly.
So the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is very weak. What I am about to tell you is the truth. If your faith is as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible Festival
(No
They came together to Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
They will kill him. On the third day he will be seen alive. Then the believers were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the price of the mosque.
Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum. And when they had come to the house, the tax collectors came to Peter and said to him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, it is," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" He asked. "Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties from? From their sons or from others?"
"From the others," Peter answered. "The two sons don't have to pay," Jesus said to him.
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your line for fishing. Take the first fish you catch. Open the fish's mouth. You will find the concordant equipment you need. Take it and present it to them as tribute for me and them.
