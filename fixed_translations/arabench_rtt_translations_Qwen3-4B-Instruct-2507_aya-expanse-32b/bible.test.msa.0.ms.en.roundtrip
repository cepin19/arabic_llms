Jesus took a little child and set him before them, and said to them, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God."
Jesus said, "What I tell you now is true. You must change and become like children. If you do not, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven."

Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me.
But what if someone were to lead one of these little ones who believe in me into sin? It would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
How near to the world will things be that drive people to sin! Such things must come. But how near to those who cause them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into the eternal fire of hell with two hands and two feet.
If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of Hell. The life of the soul is more precious than anything else.
See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for, I tell you, in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 cows, and one collapses. Will he leave the 99 cows on the mountains? Will he go and look for the cow that ran away?
What I'm about to tell you is the truth. If he finds that sheep, he is more happy to have it than the 99 that were not lost.
This is how your Father in heaven is. He doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone does wrong to you
If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him over.
But what if they will not listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. The book says, "On the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you close on earth will be opened in heaven. What you open on earth will be closed in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"I am with them whenever they gather together or in groups of three in My name." The Messenger to whom forgiveness was not granted.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
As the king began to do that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay, so the creditor seized him. He was forced to sell his wife, children, and all his possessions to cover his debts.
The servant fell at his feet and said, "Give me time, and I will pay you back everything."
His owner felt sorry for him, forgave him for what he owed, and let him go.
But then this worker went and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars, took him, and began to choke him, saying, "Pay back what you owe me!"
The other servant fell on his knees and said, "Give me time, I will repay you."
But the first refused. So he went and had the man put in prison until he should pay back what was due.
The other servants saw what had happened. They were greatly disturbed by it. So they went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then the master called the first servant. He said, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me."
Why didn't you spare yourself on the other server as you spared me?
In anger, he sent him back to the prisoners. He will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
So shall it be done to each one of you by my Father in heaven, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A large number of people followed him, and he healed them there.
Some of the Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They were not therefore two, but one. Therefore, a man is not to separate what God has joined together.
They asked: "So why did Moses command a man to write a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
Here is what I tell you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is only allowed to divorce his wife if she has not been faithful to him.
The Muslims said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to enter into marriage."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining unmarried. Only those to whom it is given can live without marriage."
Some men are born that way and are given the gift of childlessness. Others are given that way by people. And others are given that way for the service of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so. "Little children are brought to Jesus"
Some people brought little children to Jesus, wanting him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to withdraw.
Jesus said, "Allow the children, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, follow the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. And Jesus said, "You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness."
Honor your parents. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I obeyed all those orders," the young man said. "What should I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When the Muslims heard this, they were truly shaken. They asked, "Who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything and followed you! What then will there be for us?"
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus said to them. "When all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who follow me will move into seats called twenty. They will rule over ten of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But those who are first will be last, and the last will be first.
The story of the workers in the field
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
I agreed to pay them the usual amount for a day's work. Then I sent them to his farm.
At nine o'clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go also and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you what is right."
So go. "He went again around noon and at three o'clock, and did the same thing."
At five o'clock, he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, "Why have you stayed here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one hired us," they answered. He said to them, "Go also and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the garden spoke to the person in charge of the workers and said, "Pay the workers their wages and tell them to go home. Start with those who were hired last, and then move on to the first ones."
The workers who were hired were sent around five o'clock. Each of them received the usual amount for a day's work.
So, when those who were appointed first came, they expected to receive a larger amount. But each of them received the usual amount for an hour's work.
When they received it, they started criticizing the owner.
"The people who were hired in the last few weeks only worked for an hour," they said. "They were paid the same amount as us. We completed most of the work and spent a full day under the hot sun."
The owner said to one of them, "Friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for a regular amount per hour?"
Get your money out and let's go. I want to pay the same amount to the ones I sent you to last time.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel deceived because I gave freely to others?
So those who are last will be first, and the first will be last. Jesus again speaks of his upcoming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them privately.
"We go to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death."
"They will hand him over to people who are not Jews. He will be mocked and beaten, and they will nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asking Jesus for help.
Zebedee's father came to Jesus, and his sons followed. She sat at Jesus' feet, and she asked him for something.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant me that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will drink from my cup. But it is not for me to grant who will sit at my right or at my left; that place belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
Ten more Muslims heard this and were enraged at the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that in the gentile world, the rulers lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them. But it shall not be so among you. Whoever would be great among you must be your servant."
Do not be like that. Rather, anyone who wishes to be considered important among you should be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many." Blind men receive sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd commanded them to stop, and asked them to be quiet, but the two men shouted all the more, saying, "Lord, Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
"Sir," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus, deeply concerned, asked about them. He touched their eyes, and immediately they could see, and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a cow tied up, with her calf beside her. Untie the cow and bring her to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say: "The king needs it." The king will send for it immediately.
This happened so that what was spoken by the messenger might be fulfilled. And he said:
Say to the presser of the grapes: "Behold, your King comes to you; He is victorious, triumphant, riding on a donkey, riding on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The Muslims did what Jesus commanded them.
They led out the horse and the child. They put their clothes on each of them. Then Jesus sat on the clothes.
A large mass of people was thrown onto the road, and others cut down trees and placed them on the road.
Some people were taken before him, and some behind him. And they all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Matthew 21:9) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. The people asked: "Who is this?"
The people answered, "This is Jesus. He is the messenger from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was driven out of his synagogue.
Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written in the book: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it a den of thieves." (John 7:11)
The disabled people, those with impairments, came to Jesus in the synagogue, and He healed them there.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did, and they saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" he said to them. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you ever read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went into Bethany, and spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was going back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
A man saw a pistachio tree by the road. He went to the tree, but found only leaves on it. Then he said to it, "Never bear fruit again!" Suddenly the tree withered.
When the Muslims saw this, they were astonished and said, "How did the fruit tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done."
If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. Questions about the authority of Christ.
Jesus entered the synagogue passageway. While he was teaching there, the rulers and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued with each other about it. "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
But what if we say, "Of men?" We fear people. Everyone believed that John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things. The Parable of the Two Sons"
What do you think about this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go today and work in the vineyard."
"I will do it," the son replied. But later he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. He answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John came to show you the right way to live. You did not believe in him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed. You saw that, yet even then you did not change your ways and believe in him. The story of the tax collectors.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned land, and he established a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He made a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. Then he leased his vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the time for storing the harvest drew near, the man sent his workers to the tenants. He asked the workers to gather his share of the fruits.
But the vineyard owners seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
Then the man sent other servants to work in the vineyard. He sent more than he had sent the first time, and they were treated the same way.
In the end, he sent his son. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to one another, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and his inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and carried him away by the back. Then they killed him.
When the field owner returns, what will he do to these trespassers?
"These evil people will be destroyed," they replied. "Then he will lease the farm to other tenants, and they will give him their share of the harvest at threshing time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
So, this is what I tell you: the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to people who produce its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be broken into pieces. But the stone will break anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the scribes listened to Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they sought a way to arrest him, but they feared the crowds. And the people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Tell them other stories. He said:
Here is what is like the kingdom of heaven. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner. He told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent two other servants. He said, "Tell those who were invited, 'I have prepared my feast. My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'"
But people didn't care. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest devoured his servants, treated them badly, and then killed them.
The king became very angry and sent his army to destroy them. They killed those criminals and burned their city.
So the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the main corners, and let everyone you find bring dinner.
Therefore the slaves went out into the streets, and gathered together all the people they found, both good and bad. And soon the place appointed for the feast was filled with guests.
The king came to see the guests and noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," he asked, "How did you get in here without a wedding suit?" The man didn't think of anything he could say.
So the king told his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him out into the darkness outside, where he will weep and gnash his teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it impossible to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees came out. And they planned to entrap Jesus in His own words.
They sent their followers to him, along with the inquisitive. They said, "Our teacher, we know that you are a man of honor. You teach the way of God sincerely. Do not allow others to tell you what to do or say. And do not be concerned about their importance."
So they said, "What do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You are the ones who are evil! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the vessel that people use to pay taxes. They made a vessel of silver for him.
He asked them, "Whose image is this? And whose words?"
"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished, and left him and went away. Marriage is when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question, saying that they do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"The doctor," they said, "this is what we told Moses. If a man dies without having sons, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married, then died, and left no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brothers. This continued until it reached the seventh brother.
In the end, the lady died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will they be? For all seven were married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not be given in marriage, for they will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Have you not read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God who was worshipped by your fathers, I am the God who was Isaac, and I am the God who was Jacob." (Hebrews 3:6) It is not the God of the dead who is believed in, but the God of the living.
When people heard this, they were amazed at what he had learned. The most important commands.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had no answer for Jesus, so they came to confront him.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
"Doctor," he asked, "What is the most important thing in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and basic command.
"The second is like it. 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'" (Luke 19:18)
All that is written in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments. Who is the Christ?
The Pharisees gathered together. And Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
So, if David calls him "Lord," how can he be David's son?
No one could reply to him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus rebukes the Pharisees and teachers of the law.
Didn't Jesus say this to the crowd and to his disciples?
"Scholars and Persians sit in Moses' seat," he said.
So, you must obey them, and do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and carry them on people's shoulders, but they don't want to lift a finger to help carry them.
Everything they do is done to be seen by others. They put small boxes containing verses from the surah on their foreheads and on their clothes. These boxes are made very wide. They also make the branches hanging from their clothes very long.
They love to sit in places of honor at meals. They also love to get the most important seats in synagogues.
They love to be summoned in shopping malls. They love to be called "Lord" by people.
But do not be called "Rabbi," for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
You should not be called a "teacher." You have one Teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you will be your worship.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
"How close you are, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You are the ones who are deceived! You have locked the kingdom of heaven in the faces of people. You do not enter yourselves, and you do not allow anyone who tries to enter."
(No
"What a tragedy for you, people of the Law and the Persians! Your lies! You roam everywhere to attract someone to your religion. Then you make him the father of a prohibition stricter than you are."
"How deadly it was to you, O you who persist in the morning! You say, 'If someone takes the promise by the direction of the mosque, it means nothing, but if someone takes the promise by the direction of the silver in his mosque, the promise becomes due.'"
You are neglectful and obstinate! What is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the mosque that makes gold forbidden?
You also say, "If anyone takes an oath by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone takes an oath by the gift that is on it, he is bound by the oath."
O blind one! Which is more important? Is it the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So, whoever is honored with promises in the name of the pray-er, is honored with promises in his name and in everything for that pray-er.
And whoever makes a covenant in the name of the mosque, makes a covenant in his own name and in the name of those present in it.
And whoever takes the covenant in the name of the heavens has taken the covenant in the name of God's generosity and that which encompasses all.
"How scantily, O lawyers and hypocrites, have ye measured! Ye are deceived! Ye give God tithes of mint, anise, and cumin; but ye have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
Oh you blind guides, who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
"What a tragedy for you, people of laws and chivalry! Your lies! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of envy. You only want to satisfy your desires."
A pharisaical act! Wash the first part of the ball and the belly, for the smooth spot will be washed.
"What a tragedy for you, people of the Law and the Persians! Your lies! Like the towers called white. They look beautiful from the outside, but inside they are filled with the bones of the dead. They are also filled with other unclean and impure things."
That's how it is with you. You seem to be doing the right thing on the outside, but inside you are full of wrong things. You display what you do not possess.
How deadly it was to you, O teachers of the law and you prey! You are the deceived! You hide the secrets of the apostles. You hide the secrets of the believers.
And you say, "Indeed, we were unaware of the wrongdoings of those who came before us, and we did not aid in the murder of the prophets."
So you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So finish the sins that those who came before you have started!
You are the ones who have caused the years of hardship! How will you escape the punishment of Hell?
So I sent to you My messengers, and scholars, and teachers. Some of them you will kill, and some of them you will crucify, and some of them you will strike on their hands and feet, and some of them you will expel from your towns.
Therefore shall ye pay the life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. I mean from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
What I'm about to tell you is true. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
O you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! Often would I have gathered your folk together with them, but you have refused to be gathered.
Look, your house remains empty.
I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End of the Age Signs
Jesus stepped away from the altar. He was walking distant when his disciples came to him. They asked that he direct his attention to the structures surrounding the altar.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. His disciples came to him in private and asked, "Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the world?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of all false prophets."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Do not be alarmed. This must happen, but the end is still to come.
The state will compete with the state. Royalty will compete with royalty. Food will decrease among people. Earthquakes will occur in many places.
All these are the beginnings of birth pangs.
They will hand you over to them, and they will treat you harshly and kill you. All people of every religion will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people will turn away from their religion, they will hate each other, and they will prefer their enemies over their own kin.
Many false prophets will arise and deceive many people.
For the abundance of evil will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But those who stay until the end will succeed.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that causes desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). You will see it stand in the holy place one day. The reader must understand this.
Let them flee who are called to the mountains.
No one on the roof is allowed to go down to their house to fetch something.
No one in the field should go back to retrieve their clothes.
How crushing it will be for the young women in those days! How crushing for the women who have no husbands!
Ask that you may not be harmed by fleeing in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be cut short.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "Here he is!" Do not believe them.
Every antichrist and all who deny prophecy will appear. They will perform great signs and oracles, and they will seek to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
So, if someone tells you, "He is far out in the desert," do not go to him. Or if someone says, "He is inside indoors," do not believe it.
The light that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a carcass.
After the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be affected." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that moment, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations on earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send His Spirit with great weight. He will gather His chosen people from all directions. He will bring them forth from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fruit tree. For when its branches broaden and its leaves bud, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all these things happening, you realize that the end is near. It is at the door.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. People who lived in that time will not die until all those things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
Remember what happened in the days of Noah, so will it be when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank, they believed, they gave their daughters in marriage, and they did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing of what was to come until the plague came and took them all. So it will be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will move and the other will stay.
Two women will be ground by a watch. One will be given, and I will keep the other.
"So know that you do not know what day your Lord will come."
You must understand something. Let's assume the homeowner knew what time of night the criminal would arrive. He would stay on the lookout. He wouldn't allow his house to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose a man appoints one of his slaves to manage the other slaves in his house. The task of this slave is to distribute food to them at the right time. The master wants an honest and intelligent slave for this task.
It will be good for the servant if he finds the listener performing his duty when he returns.
What I am about to tell you is a fact. The rightful owner will place this worker in charge of everything he possesses.
But suppose the worker is bad. Suppose he says to himself: "My boss is still away for a long time."
So he began to beat other workers, and he ate and drank with those who drank heavily.
The owner of this slave will return on a day the slave does not expect. He will come at a time the slave does not know.
Then the carcass will be cut into pieces. It will be sent to the place where the bidders go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
A Tale of Ten Brides
Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Four of them were stupid. Four were smart.
Those who were weak took their lamps, but they took no oil of the beaten olives.
The smart ones took Zita in vessels with their lights.
The groom didn't come for a long time, so the bride became anxious and fell asleep.
At midnight someone shouted, "Here is your husband! Come out and see him!"
Then all the brides woke up and each of them asked for her lamp.
Those known for their diligence said to those known for their wisdom: "Give us some of your oil. Our lights are going out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for all of us. Stay here and move on to those who sell oil, and buy some for your families."
So I went to buy oil. But as they were heading out, the wedding party arrived. The brides who were ready with him entered the wedding dinner. Then the door was closed.
Then came the other brides. She said, "Gentlemen! Gentlemen!" "Open the door for us!"
But he answered: "What I am going to tell you is true. I do not know you."
So, keep in touch. You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom comes. The story of the three devoted men.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one, $4,000 to another, and $2,000 to the third. He gave each worker the amount he knew the worker could secure. Then he left on his trip.
The servant who received the sum of $10,000 immediately went to work and earned an additional amount equal to $10,000.
He who gained $4000 gained an additional $4000.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the owner of these workers returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you saved me $10,000, look, I've made an extra $10,000."
His master answered, "You have done well, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!"
The man who had $4000 also came. He said, "Sir, you saved me $4000, look, I've made an extra $4000."
His master answered, "You have done well, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then the man who received the $2000 came and said, "Sir, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed."
That's why I was scared. I went out and withdrew $2000 from the ground. Look, here's what's yours.
His master answered, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest what I do not plant? Did you know that I gather crops from where I did not scatter seed?"
Well, I should put my money in the bank. When I return, I'll get my money with interest.
Then the owner commanded the other servants, saying, "Take the amount that is equal to $2000 from him, and give it to the one who has $20,000."
He who has will be given more; and he who does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
Throw this valueless worker outside. In the darkness there, people will weep and mock him. "Cows and sheep"
The Son of Man will come in all his greatness. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven.
All the people will be gathered before him, and they will be separated into two groups. It will be like the shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
Then the King will speak to those on his right, saying: "I bestow upon you the blessings of my Father; come, take your inheritance, for it has been prepared for you since the creation of the world."
I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
I needed clothes, and they came to me. I was sick, and they came to me. I was in prison, and they came to me.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?"
At any time did we see you in need and call you in? At any time did we see you lacking clothes and provide them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and visited you?
The King will answer and say, "What I am about to tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you have done for Me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me. I needed clothes. But you gave me nothing. I was sick and in prison. But you did not care for me.
They will also say: "Lord, when did we see you lying in the streets or in need, and not help you? When did we see you hungry or thirsty, naked or sick, or in prison, and not assist you?"
He will answer, "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you have not done for the least of these, you have not done for me."
So they will go to punishment for ever. But those who have done good will have eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things, and then said to his disciples:
As you know, Easter is two days away. The Son of Man will be delivered to be crucified.
Then the chief priests met with the elders and the people. They gathered in the court of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They devised a plan to arrest Jesus cunningly. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the Muslims saw this, they protested. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. This money could have been given to poor people.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
There will always be needy people by your side, but you won't always find me.
She placed the site on my body to consecrate me so that I may be preserved.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you have done will become known wherever this good news is proclaimed in all the world, and you will forever be remembered for it. "Yoda agrees to hand over Jesus."
One of the twenty went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas was waiting for the right moment to hand Jesus over to them. The supper of God's man.
It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The Jews came to Jesus and asked him, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He answered, "Go to a certain man and say to him, 'The teacher says, "My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover in your house with my disciples."'"
So, the Muslims followed what Jesus told them to do. They prepared a Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."
The Muslims became sad. Then they started saying to him one by one: "Not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who has dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
It was Yoda who was to present him. He said, "Not I, Lord, am I?" And Jesus answered, "Yes, you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink ye all of it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
Here's what I'm telling you. From now on, I'm not drinking wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."
Jesus said to them, "You will all be saddened this night because of me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter answered, "Everyone else may leave you, but I will never leave you."
"What I am telling you is the truth," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may die with you, but I will not say that I do not know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and said to them, "Sit here, while I go yonder and pray."
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
So he told them, "My heart is overwhelmed with sadness, and I feel as if I am about to die. Stay here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
So he returned to His servants and found them asleep. He said, "Why did you not remain with me even for a single hour?" And He asked about Peter.
Listen and work on prayer, for you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus was sent again. He prayed, saying, "Father, if this cup can be taken away, let it be taken away. But if I must drink it, let your will be done."
Then he returned and found them asleep. He could not keep their eyes open.
So he pursued and ran again. And asked a third time the same thing.
Then he returned to the Muslims and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and idling? Look! The hour is near. The Son of Man is being handed over to sinners."
"Wake up! Let's go! He who betrays me is coming!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. They were sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, signaled to the betrayers. He said, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one." Then he said, "Seize him."
So Yoda went to Jesus at once and said, "Hello, Teacher!" and then hit him with his bread.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men came near, pushed Jesus away, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' friends drew his sword, pulled it out, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask for my father's help? He would immediately deploy a force of over 70,000 angels.
But then how can books come into being? They say they must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a band of armed soldiers against you? Why do you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I have been sitting in the temple teaching every day, and you did not arrest me."
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Jesus was taken to the high priest.
Jesus was taken by those who had seized him, and brought before Caiaphas, the high priest. A council was assembled, composed of the scribes and the elders.
He did not go far from there, but followed Jesus. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The nuns and all the Sanhedrin were looking for something that could be used against Jesus. They wanted him to be killed.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses appeared.
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the mosque of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the elder son was angry, and said to his father, "Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a commandment
But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes, that is exactly as you say," Jesus replied. "But I tell you all: In the coming days, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Holy One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
So the narrator took off his clothes and said, "He has done an evil thing against God! Why do we need additional witnesses? You have heard what he said, an evil thing."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they cursed his face. They hit him with their hands. Others hit him.
They said, "Tell us, Jesus! Who hit you?" And Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the garden. A maid came to him and said, "I also was with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate that led to the garden. And there another woman saw him, and she said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that it wasn't so. With oaths he said, "I don't know this man!"
After a short while, those who were there approached Peter and said, "You are one of them," "Your speech gives you away."
So Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Yoda hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided that Jesus should be killed.
They threw themselves upon him, carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate, who was the judge.
Yoda, having betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep guilt and sorrow for his deed. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I handed over a man who has no punishment," he said. "What's it to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility."
Therefore, Yoda threw the amount in a mosque, then left, and then went and collapsed.
The elder chiefs invented the expiatory fund. They said, "Putting this money in the expiatory fund of the deserving is forbidden, for it is blood money, paid in exchange for the life of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy a field for making plates. People from other countries will remain buried there.
And that is why it is still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then what he said proved true to the Messenger. He said, "They took thirty pieces of silver as its price, the amount the children of Israel determined as his value."
They used the thirty pieces of silver to buy a potter's field, as the Lord commanded me. (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is presented to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the judge. The judge asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
But when the leaders and elders came to criticize him, he did not respond.
So Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the accusation they are making against you?"
But Jesus did not answer a single charge. The judge was actually taken with genuine admiration.
It was the Governor's practice at Lent to release one prisoner. The people chose whom they wanted to be released.
At that time they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one of these two do you want me to release? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were excited. He knew that was the reason they handed Jesus over to him.
While Judge Pilat was sitting on the bench, his wife sent him a message saying: "Don't deal with this man, he is innocent. I had a terrible dream about him today."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
"Which of these two do I want to release?" asked the Governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ? asked Pilate. And they all said, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder: "Crucify him!"
Belat saw that there was no progress, but people were becoming angry. He took the water and washed his hands in front of them. He said, "I am not responsible for this man's death," and then said, "You are responsible for it!"
All the people answered: "We and our children will accept responsibility for his death!"
Reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached, reached.
Then the soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which is called the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison around him.
They took off his clothes and put purple clothes on his leg.
So they threw upon them a storm of fire and a storm of stones, and they became as charred grass.
They cursed him. They hit his head with a stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his clothing, and then dressed him in his own clothes. Then they took him away and crucified him. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
As they were leaving the city, they noticed a man from Cyrene. His name was Simon. They compelled him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull."
They added a mixture of spicy herbs to the wine and offered it to Jesus to drink. But after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They settled and took a look at it.
They placed on his head the sign that read, "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
Two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
Those who passed by Jesus shook their heads and mocked him.
He said, "So will you destroy the vine and harvest it in three days? Give up on yourself! Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God!"
Similarly, visions heard him, and the teachers of the people mocked him, and the houses scorned him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
It depends on God. If He wills, God will save him. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
Similarly, the criminals who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three o'clock, darkness covered the earth completely.
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34)
I hear some of those who were there crying out to Jesus. They said, "Elijah is called."
Then one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the idol's ribbon was cut from top to bottom. The ground shook. The rocks split apart.
The graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
Come out of the dead. After Jesus was raised to life, I went to the holy city, where I appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards, who were watching Jesus, saw the earthquake and everything that happened. They were terrified and said, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to meet his needs.
Mary Magdalene was one of them. Mary, the mother of James and Joses, was also there. And the mother of Zebed's children. Jesus is buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea came. His name was Joseph. He became a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for his body. And Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and covered it with a clean cloth.
He placed him in his new tomb he had hewn from the rock. Then he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene came to the tomb again, and there she sat beside it, weeping. The guards of the tomb
The next day was the day after the preparation day. The chiefs and the brush went to Belat.
"The lord," they said, "recalls something the liar said while he was alive. He said, 'I will rise again in three days.'"
So, they were ordered to secure the tomb until the third day. If you don't do that, his disciples may come and steal the body. Then they will tell people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. And that last lie will be worse than the first one.
"Bring some guards with you," replied Belat. "Go and make the alarm secure as best you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
It ended on Saturday. Noon was on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went again to observe the tomb.
There was a mighty earthquake. A host from your Lord came down from the sky. The host went to the tomb, and the stone returned and sat on its place.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards feared him greatly, trembling and becoming like a dead man.
The angels said to the women, "Do not be afraid, I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was killed by poison."
Not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Go and see the place where he was buried.
Go quickly! Tell Moses, "He has risen from the dead, and he will go ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him." This is what I have told you now.
So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, but filled with joy. They rushed to tell the disciples.
Suddenly, he met them. He said, "Hello!" They came to him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me there." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards entered the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chiefs and leaders assembled, they proposed a plan. They offered the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers: "I want you to say, 'His servants came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him off. That will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This account has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his followers.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. Yet some still doubted.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Tell them to obey everything I commanded you. And know that I am with you always, until the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
In a distant time, the prophet Joshua wrote: "I will send my messengers before you, and I will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths." (Isaiah 40:3)
So John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
All the people from the countryside of Judah came to him, and all the people from Jerusalem as well. When they confessed that they had been delivered, they bathed in the Jordan River.
John was wearing clothes made of donkey fur. He had a leather belt around his waist. He was eating sugar birds and kumquats.
Here is what John proclaimed: "One mightier than I is coming after me. I am not worthy to untie his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. 'Jesus is baptized and tested.'"
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up from the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens open, and he saw a holy spirit descend upon him like a dove.
A voice came from heaven, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
In a moment, the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. Satan tempted him. The wild beasts did not harm Jesus. Angels ministered to him. Jesus chose the first disciples.
After John was thrown into prison, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
"I will make you fishers of men," said Jesus.
They cast out their nets immediately and followed him.
Then Jesus went a little further. As he walked, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Immediately he cried out to them, "What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of Go
Jesus and his family went to Capernaum. And on the Sabbath day, he went to the synagogue and began to teach there.
His teaching amazed people. He instructed them as if he had authority. He didn't speak like the law teachers.
At that moment, a man shouted in their mosque. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil devil shook the man violently, then emerged from him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed, and they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! Even the demons obey him and submit."
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue and went immediately with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother lay sick in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her to rise. The fever left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening after sunset, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus, and all who were demon-possessed.
All the people in the town gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them, suffering from various diseases. He also cast out many demons, but he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a solitary place.
It was still early in the morning, and darkness still reigned. Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friend went to see Jesus.
When they found him, they cried: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
Therefore he traveled throughout Galilee. He preached in their synagogues. He also cast out demons. Jesus heals a man with leprosy.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, fell on his knees, and pleaded, "If you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was deeply troubled. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean!"
The disease was immediately driven out of him, and he was healed.
Jesus sent him immediately and sternly warned the man.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and confess to the priest. Perform the sacrifices that Moses commanded. That will be a testimony before the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to speak immediately. The news spread among everyone. So Y’shua could not enter any city openly. He remained outside the cities in solitary places. But people still came to him from all directions.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned to his home.
A large crowd gathered, so that there was no more room. Not even outside the door was there space. And Jesus spoke to the people.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they opened up the roof above Jesus and lowered the man down on a mat through the tiles.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of my law teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something evil! Only God can forgive mistakes!
In a moment, Jesus knew what the people were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your bed and go"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
"I say to you," he said, "rise. Take up your bed and go to your home."
The man rose and took up his bed, and went away to his home. And all were amazed, and they glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose Levi.
Jesus went back to the shore of Lake Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus dined at Levi's house. There were many tax collectors and those called "sinners" dining with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his followers, "Why does Jesus eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." He was asked about fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples used to fast. Then some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but yours do not."
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But a time will come when the husband will be excluded from among them. On that day they will go without eating.
People do not sew a piece of new cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new part will separate from the old part, making the tear worse.
"No one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry, and they needed food."
That was when Abiathar was high priest. David went into the house of God and did eat the shewbread, which was lawful to eat only for the priests. And he gave also to his men of it.
Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
So, it is man's right even on the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
On another occasion, Jesus went to the school. There was a man who had a weak and withered hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely, eager to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man who had the withered and crooked hand, "Stretch out your hand before everyone."
So Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or destroy them?" But they remained silent.
Jesus looked at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as before.
So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together and plotted how they might kill Jesus. The people followed Jesus.
Jesus sent his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people were amazed at all that Jesus did. Then he went to the other side of the Jordan, and large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across the Jordan.
Because the people were pressing in on him, Jesus said to his disciples, "Have a small boat ready for me, so that the crowd does not crush me."
Jesus had healed many people, so the sick were pressing to touch him.
When the people saw those with evil spirits, they fell before him. And the spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man who he was. Jesus appoints the twenty years.
Jesus went up on a mountain, and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.
He appointed ten of them, and took them as Muslims. Afterwards, they will be with him. And he will show them to the mosques.
They had authority to cast out demons.
Therefore Jesus sent out the twelve. And Simon was one of them. And Jesus gave him the name Peter.
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John were given the name Boanerges by Jesus. Boanerges means "sons of thunder."
There were Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and Thaddaeus, the son of Alphaeus. There were also Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub
Jesus entered a house. And again a large crowd gathered, so large that Jesus and his disciples were not able to eat.
His family heard about it, so they went to take responsibility. They said, "He is insane."
There were some teachers of the law. They came from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
So Jesus took them and began to tell them parables. He said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom competes against itself, it will not be motivated.
If the family is torn apart, it won't be able to survive.
