Jesus called a little child to him and set the child among them.
Jesus said, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. You must change and become like little children. If you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me were to stumble? If they did, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.

If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into the eternal fire with two hands and two feet.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost. Won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go look for the one that is lost?
What I am about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he is happier about the one than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
The same applies to your Father in heaven. He does not want to perish any of these little ones. When one of them sins against you
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him how he has wronged you. Keep the matter between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have gained him back.
But what if he does not listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established. (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them." - The servant who did not show mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When the king began, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master issued an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he owned were to be sold to pay off his debts.
The slave fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll give everything back."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave him his debt and let him go.
But that servant went out and found another servant who owed him a little money. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay what you owe me!"
The other man fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. They were very disturbed. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then the lord called the first servant and said, "Wicked servant! I forgave you all your debt because you begged me."
Did you not have mercy on the other servant as I had mercy on you?
Angrily, his master handed him over to the guards. He would be punished until he repaid all his debts.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus said, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a man a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus said, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because you were hard-hearted, but it was not this way from the beginning."
Here's what I tell you. Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is not permitted to divorce his wife unless she is unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are given the grace to live without marriage can accept it."
"Some men are unable to reproduce because they were born that way. Some were made so by other people. Others have made themselves so in order to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so." Little children are brought to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man approached Jesus. He asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
Why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus answered, "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness."
'Honor your father and your mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have kept all these commandments." "What do I still need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful. For he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you. What then will we have?"
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus said to them. "When all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will also have eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you what is right."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others still standing around him. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one has hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and going to the first."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock arrived. Each of them received their usual daily wage.
When those who were first hired came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said: "These people who were last hired only worked for one hour. You paid them the same wage you paid us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
One of them answered the owner, saying, "Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?
Take your money and go. I want to give the people I hired recently the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave others a lot of freedom?
"But many who are last will be first, and the first last." Jesus speaks again about His upcoming death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. People will mock him and beat him. They will nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Promise me that one of my sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise me that the other will sit at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like this. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many. Two blind men receive their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They begged them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, saying, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
They said, "O Lord, we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone tells you something, say that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them immediately.
This happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
Bring the donkey and the colt. Put their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large crowd spread out their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and scattered them across the path.
Some people preceded him, and some followed him. All of them shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were selling and buying there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you make it a 'den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
Blind and disabled people came to Jesus in the temple. There, he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
Do you hear what these children are saying? they asked him. Jesus said, Yes. Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? It says, "You have entrusted to children and infants the defense of your cause." (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he saw a fig tree by the roadside. He went to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He approached it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. They said, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus said, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. You must believe and not doubt. Then you can do what was done to the fig tree. And you can say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea.' And it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus said, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
Jesus answered, "I do not know." Then Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The story of the two sons.
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
The son said, "I won't do it." But later he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
Which of the two sons did what his father wanted? "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. You saw this, yet you did not turn from your sins and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. A man owned a piece of land. He planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it. He dug a well to press the wine in. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some peasants. Then he went on a journey.
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. He commanded the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants caught his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned him to death.
Then the man sent other slaves to the tenants. He sent more than he had the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to the tenants?
"The wicked tenants will be destroyed," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be given to other tenants who will give the owner his share of the harvest."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what the Scriptures say? 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.'" (Psalm 118:22-23)
So I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will crush whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the crowd. The people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said,
Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent out other slaves, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and all is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The rest held onto his servants. They mistreated them and then killed them.
The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they could find, good and bad alike. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend asked, "How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The trap was set. They made plans to catch Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a person of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't allow others to command you, or tell you what to do or say. You don't care how important they are."
So tell us, then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes." They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose is this picture? And whose are these words?"
They said, "To Caesar." Then he said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished. They left him and went away. The dead will rise from their graves.
On that day, the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and continuing until the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise from their graves, whose wife will she be? She was married to all seven.
Jesus said, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise from their graves, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught with authority. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets depends on these two commandments." Who is the son of man?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself."
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him "Lord," how can he be his son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
So you must obey them. Do everything they command you to do. But do not do what they do. For they do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves do not want to lift a finger to move them.
All that they do is done to be seen by others. They put small boxes containing verses from the Bible on their foreheads and arms. They make the boxes very wide. And they lengthen the pendants on their coats very much.
They love to sit in the places of honor at dinner. They also love to have the most important seats in the synagogue.
They love to be welcomed in the markets. They love it when people call them 'my lord'.
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher.' You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those who are entering go in.
(No
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Oh, what a marvel, O leaders of the blind! You say, "If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing. But if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath."
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
It also says: "If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he must keep his oath."
Oh blind men! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that sanctifies the gift?
"So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it."
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And everyone who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and the One who sits on it.
You blind guides, you Pharisees! You hypocrites! You pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: judgment and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
O you blind guides, who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
You snakes! You brood of vipers! How can you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore, I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers, and some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. So on your heads will fall the guilt of all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this very generation will be held accountable for it all.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, and then the outside will also be clean.
You snakes! You brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous, and you say, “If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.” Thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your ancestors! You vipers, you brood of vipers! How can you escape being condemned to hell?
The same goes for you. From the outside, you seem to be doing what's right. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You pretend to be something you're not.
You snakes! You brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? Therefore, I am sending you prophets and sages and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town.
And they say: "If we had been in the days of our predecessors, we would not have been partners in the killing of the prophets."
For you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So complete the sins which those before you have begun!
Your nest is full of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to fire?
Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill some of them, and crucify some, and scourge others in your synagogues, and chase them from city to city.
Therefore shall ye pay the life of all the righteous men who have been slain on earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah the son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
What I'm about to tell you is true. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
O Jerusalem! O Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house has become empty.
I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. His disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus said, "Watch out! Be on your guard against deception."
Many will come in my name, claiming, "I am the Messiah!" They will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about wars in the future. Do not be alarmed. Those things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then people will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many will fall away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For the abundance of wickedness will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. And then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get something.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
How terrible it will be in those days for pregnant women! How terrible for nursing mothers!
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than anything from the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
The Antichrist and false prophets will appear. They will perform great wonders and signs. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "It's in the middle of the desert," don't go there. Or if someone says, "It's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a corpse.
After the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. He will gather His chosen people from the four corners of the earth. He will bring them from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. Once its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It's at the door.
What I am about to tell you is true. The people who were living at that time would certainly not die until all those things happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour.
No one knows that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They did all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will grind using a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
"So be wary. You do not know the day your Lord will come."
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. Then he would have stayed awake. He wouldn't have let the thief break into his house.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Assume that a master entrusts one of his slaves with managing the other slaves in his household. The slave's task is to provide them with food on time. The master wants a trustworthy and wise slave for this matter.
It will be well for the servant if the master finds him doing his work when he returns.
What I am about to tell you is true. The master will make that slave accountable for everything he owns.
But suppose that slave is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master is staying away a long time."
Suppose he starts beating the other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink heavily.
The master of that slave will return on a day when the slave does not expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then Mr. will tear it to pieces. He will send it to the place where the protesters go. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Story of the Ten Bridegirls
Here is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. And five were wise.
Fools took their lamps but didn't bring any olive oil with them.
The wise took the oil in their jars along with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. All the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted, "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the incubators woke up and prepared their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But on their way, the bridegroom arrived. The girls who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was shut.
Later, the rest of the incubators also came. "Master! Master!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
"Be watchful! You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come." - The Parable of the Three Servants.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave one ten thousand dollars. He gave another four thousand dollars. He gave a third two thousand dollars. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received the ten thousand dollars immediately went and invested his money. He made another ten thousand dollars.
He who earned $4,000 earned an additional $4,000.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
The man with $4,000 also came. "Sir," he said, "you trusted me with $4,000. Look, I've made an additional $4,000."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then came the man who had received the $2000. He said, "Sir, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
So I was afraid. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is what belongs to you.
The master replied, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you not know that I sow where I have not plowed? Did you not know that I gather the harvest where I did not scatter the seed?
Well, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I return, I would have received it with interest.
Then his master commanded the other servants, "Take $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000."
To those who have, more will be given. They will have more than enough. What about those who have nothing? Even what they have will be taken from them.
"Cast that worthless servant outside. There in the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth." 'The sheep and the goats'
The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All nations will be gathered before Him. People will be separated into two groups. It will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, take your inheritance, the kingdom that was prepared for you since the creation of the world.'
I was hungry. You gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. You gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. You invited me in.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, “Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?”
When did we see you a stranger and invite you? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The king will answer: "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.”
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not let me in. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not care for me.
They will also say: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes, or sick or in prison and did not assist you?"
He will answer, "What I tell you is true. Whatever you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous will receive eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
But not during the feast, they said. People might cause trouble. A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What I have done will be told everywhere this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in remembrance of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" They counted out thirty pieces of silver to him.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The pupils became very sad. One by one, they began to say to him, "Not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "Is it I, Lord?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take this and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, praised Allah, and passed it to them. He said, "All of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Here is what I tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, you will all deny me because of me. It is written: 'Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter replied, "Others may falter because of you, but I never will."
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus answered. "It will happen this very night. Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me."
He went a little forward. Then he fell with his face to the ground. He prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet not my will, but yours be done."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Watch and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. Again, he found them sleeping. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. "Are you still sleeping and resting?" he asked them. "Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners.
Rise up! Let us go! There is the one who betrays me to them! "Jesus is arrested"
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests, the rulers, and the elders had sent them.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. He said, "The one I kiss is the man. Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Put your sword back in its place, Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how will the scriptures be fulfilled then? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. He said, "Am I leading a band of armed men against you? Why do you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus in order to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men are accusing you of?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered. "It is as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard him say this evil thing."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their hands. Others slapped his face.
They said, "Tell us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said that he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
But before everyone, Peter said it wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. There another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said it wasn't so. He swore, "I don't know the man!"
After a short while, those standing there approached Peter. They said, "You must be one of them. Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said. "The cock will crow," Jesus had told him. "Before it crows, you will deny three times that you know me." Peter went outside. He broke down and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away, and delivered him to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I made a mistake." He replied, "I released an innocent man." They answered, "What's it to us?" "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the silver into the temple and went out. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests picked up the coins. They said, "It is against the law to put this money into the temple treasury. It is blood money. It was paid to kill a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That's why it is still called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words which Jeremiah the prophet had spoken were fulfilled: "They took thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the sons of Israel."
"They used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is presented to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked, "Don't you hear the accusation they are making against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose whom they wanted.
At that time, they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
When the chief priests and the people gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered much in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders persuaded the multitude to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
The governor asked, "Which one do you want me to release?" They answered, "Barabbas."
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. All answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Seeing that he was getting nowhere, Pilate decided to release Jesus. But the crowd became insistent, so he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he declared. "It is your responsibility!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he ordered Jesus to be flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. Soldiers mock Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They removed his clothes and put a purple cloak on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They urinated on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe. They put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to be crucified on the cross. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene. His name was Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes by casting lots.
They sat there and watched him.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two criminals were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "Will you destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Then save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he is God's son. For he said, "I am God's son."
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.
Graves were opened. The lives of many holy people who had died were restored.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and cried out, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also there. So was the mother of Zebed's sons. Jesus is buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed him in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir, they said, "We remember something the liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So guard the tomb until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
Now when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
A strong earthquake occurred. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here! He has risen from the dead, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, filled with fear and joy, and ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Greetings!" They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards entered the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him off. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshipped him. But some still had their doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end of the age.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He baptized people in the desert. He preached that people should be baptized and repent of their sins, and then God would forgive them.
All the people from the countryside of Judea were going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem also. And as they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
Here is what John preached: "After me comes one who is greater than I. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven spoke to him. It said, "You are my Son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
Immediately, the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for forty days. The devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt him. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
"The time is fulfilled," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. I will make you fishers of men.
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he did so, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and they went after Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one who had authority, not as the scribes.
At that moment, a man shouted in their temple. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it exited him with a scream.
All the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Immediately they went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her to stand. The fever had left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a quiet place.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness reigned. Jesus got up from his sleep and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they cried, "Everyone's looking for you!"
Jesus said, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I want to preach there also. That is why I came."
So he traveled throughout all of Galilee. And he preached in their synagogues and cast out demons. Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and begged him. He said, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing." "Be cleansed!"
Immediately the disease left him. He was healed.
Jesus sent him immediately. He gave the man a severe warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news everywhere. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly; he remained outside in secluded places. Yet the people still came to him from every quarter.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum. The people heard that he had returned to his home.
So many people came that there was no more room, not even outside the door. And Jesus began to teach them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, letting down their mat, they lowered the man.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were contemplating this in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, take your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
"I tell you," he said, "get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man rose and picked up his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee, and a great crowd followed him. He began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was having dinner at Lazarus's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and "sinners"?
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast. But yours do not. Why?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will tear away from the old one. This will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. - Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
He replied, "Haven't you read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
That was when Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests. He also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Another time Jesus entered the synagogue. There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the withered and paralyzed hand. He said, "Stand up before everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say? What should we do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was greatly disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy Him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, and the surrounding regions, including Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the area around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus ordered his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This was to prevent the people from crowding around him.
Jesus had healed many people. So the sick came forward to touch him.
When the people saw him with the evil spirits, they fell before him. The spirits cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up on a mountainside. He called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They had the power to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed the twelve. Simon was one of them, and Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and the swallow.
Jesus entered a house. Again a large crowd gathered. It was so large that even Jesus and his disciples could not eat.
His family heard about it. They went to take care of him. They said, "He's out of his mind."
There were some scribes. They came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
