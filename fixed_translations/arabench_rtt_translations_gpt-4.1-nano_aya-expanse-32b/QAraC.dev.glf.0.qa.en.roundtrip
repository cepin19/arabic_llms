I'm saying what you refuse to understand, Saleh.
enzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzrting What'ssers you? Saleh, open your eyes, open your mind, look at the world around you, see what people are doing.
enzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzers my brother is blind
He refuses to improve himself and improve those around him.
Oh Saleh... don't be stubborn.
enzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzenz; No, I donn t, I d, d, d, d, d. No, t, d. t, 0 t, 0, no, I don't care 0 t, 0 about 1 d, 0 0f, 1g 1t.
Walking in the street
And some dates, two dates were thrown.
enzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzenzed: And you are hungry
Will you eat or not?
No, I'll eat.
Tell me, did he accept it?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I'm done with him.
This is our chance, our cars are embarrassingly old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
Fool! He lacks self-confidence.
Hey, are you scared?
The thing that really bothers me
He is responsible for the budget.
What is this project that he is responsible for?
It's a massive government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Mom, how could you forget!
And today in the garage
This means that I will
I consider myself a participant!
It's not fair that I don't benefit from this.
Won't I get anything?
This means I'm involved too.
We're all supposed to take.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son won't understand.
I'll talk to him.
The good that you reject
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Just like everyone else does.
A feast of luck is before you.
Take your share.
He had only one riyal in his pocket.
I heard him myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the third and final one is looting.
His son Salam
Went to Souq Waqif
One lamp costs eighteen riyals.
Set its price in the budget.
One hundred and eighty riyals each.
They said we didn't make any mistakes.
You'll get bored of it.
"And seek refuge from the devil."
Yeah, but I think he changed his mind.
God willing, my God.
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
Most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your friends.
We need to be together.
Such a government project is an opportunity.
Sure, Ali!
We can't do it without you.
Don't worry, Ali!
And if God wills, all those included in the project.
Of course
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
From your side
We're not worried because you're members of the project committee.
Concerned about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't worry, Ali!
And tell your friends not to worry.
Really, my brother! Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
But oh! Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
Let Saleh agree first.
I'll take care of it.
I was wondering if I'd get some interest.
Is it possible?
So, you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is that it remains a secret between us.
And I found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
Sure, I will.
To your health and happiness
What's wrong with you!
If you stay distracted like this,
It's not going to work.
This isn't going to work.
Or questions
We'd be happy to help.
How do we get our share?
Is it logical?
What shall we call it!
Also, we're not the only ones who will take
Every participant is asking for their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh.
We're the ones who determine the budget.
What about the land he bought today?
Did he just find her too?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
He called me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's wrong?"
Tell your brother.
The second earth
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
The sale has been approved.
He said, "Please call him to confirm if he wants it, and I'll book it for him."
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
What about our money?
We are considered accomplices with him.
Even if we weren't participants!
You're taking a big bite for yourself.
At least give your brother and mother something.
I'm not here to beg you.
We are participants in the project as well, we have the right to claim our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It's true that when the sultan came and asked for his share, he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You need to give him a share of the project.
Phase one
You're no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him speaking to them.
They let their brothers and friends enter.
I know that government projects are free for anyone.
We don't just want a limited amount of money.
From contributed capital
His brother Sultan can attend committee meetings if he wishes.
because it seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want to
Thank you.
Ah, Abu Saleh
Your wife's brother!
You're going to like it.
He will benefit the project.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, Saleh!
I'll be responsible for the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Oh people!
Take your share.
I, by God,
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And sometimes I say
Let me take a cut.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want using your preferred method.
The most important thing,
We, too,
Even during this week,
Everyone determines the amount of money they want to have.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
He asked for an additional hundred thousand.
Okay, but why like this, huh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your own looting, ignore him.
There's also the orphans' money.
More budget.
Many people like to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What's this! Is this your father's project!
Yes, he is the sultan.
My brother, Sultan.
It means he is involved.
Is that the nickname?
Your friend Saud includes many names.
He always adds names and says, "Let's benefit from them."
So which set do I add it to, the percentage or the amount of money?
No, put him with the beggars.
How much should you allocate to him! Put twenty thousand for him.
Yes, enough.
They even add a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
But, Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of it will be considered part of the Phase One budget.
As a bundle, no one notices.
Yes, there's also the list that my mom sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without permission.
Haha, may you live long.
My beloved, my son.
God bless you, %pw is sick and poor.
But the woman doesn't have money.
May God bless you, I told you this last time.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
Hey! Wait, wait... How much do you need?
Enough for the liver, the stay, and the hospital!
Around one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers do you transplant?
One, but my sister is precious.
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hussaina, yes yes, Hussaina bint Hilal.
Are you giving her your own money!
Reassure him and tell him that I won't take anything from phase two.
Yes, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Dude, they're going to replace her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
Alvin
Write for me.
Yes, Hassiba is the daughter of Hlal.
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No, Mother.
I have a lot of work.
Then, I'll call you later.
The people who ate from the feast increased.
The infrastructure is capable of enduring.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they will give us payments continuously.
How much? We want to know!
Will they give it to us all at once or in installments?
Why does she get more than us?
Whether it's a power outage or a robbery, it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you stay quiet. We're waiting for them to come.
He told you to stop talking, so you stopped talking.
Don't be shy.
If I hear any of you speaking
I'll sew his mouth shut.
You've been keeping us waiting for too long.
You know this is money, it's not a simple matter.
How long ago was it?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking a big bite.
You're the boss after all.
We don't want a headache.
Let's agree on the budget.
Mr. Saleh, from your talk about the project, we noticed that it is a vital and very important project as well.
And it is not for this generation only.
Yes yes
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
We would like to thank you for your presence, and congratulations once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
Where are we heading!
I don't know where we are.
I'm bored.
Don't you think the officials spoke and the people cheered for them with their hands?
We're at the official opening, what's wrong with you?
Present now speak, this means we are in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people sweat.
And these sections, I don't know what they put inside them.
Leave the box alone.
These sections are the infrastructure.
Official Opening of International Beaches
Third millennium, what's wrong with you.
I honestly don't know.
Yes, praise be to God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why they made me resign.
He just parks his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there's a big farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
You receive checks while comfortably at home.
Why the tiredness, my dear, don't let anyone pass through your mind, Mona.
You should thank your God, Munira, that you have brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Qaser.
Whoever worries about your portion and invests it.
Look at my aunt's friend now.
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We don't act this way.
This is your legal right.
It's a matter of trust... not that you trust us!
I don't know.
I didn't feel satisfied with what my brother, Rashid, said.
He always reminds me of the cheque they give me every three months.
But, this is true.
He always tells me.
You don't trust us.
Financial matters and inheritance must be clear.
If you, my dear, are not satisfied
Do you know what it does to people?
And the mother of Salman is an example for you, O poor lady.
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But work is work, and it's your legal right.
And then what?
We run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems, no headache.
She said she was passing by the land, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister has started *searching*.
This is the problem.
She plans to embarrass us.
It's kind of like giving her money.
Calm down, Falcon.
We must find a solution to this, Rashid.
In my head
What is this?
A share of my father's inheritance
The good they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
As if they aren't investing the money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
Clear.
They said let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking.
This is true, everything you said is correct.
Give it to me little by little.
Just see their wives.
He has many different diamond jewelry pieces.
I don't have what they have.
They don't feel I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
Your right
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they are stealing from me and lying to me.
I don't feel comfortable with the way they behave.
Life is unpredictable, oh! Dearie me.
They exhausted me, made me feel sick. Oh, my darling!
They don't know there's an account and punishment.
And that God will punish them for taking people's money.
And be careful, don't mention anything about the court to them, my dear!
They will be happy.
Is it because of our large population?
That's why I say to you, my beloved!
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that resembles a skyscraper.
I just want what's rightfully mine.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
And give to the poor.
The mother is the mother of Slemain.
Keep it calm, dear.
And don't mention anything to them about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Her rights are being stripped away.
You were wondering about the accountant.
Who are you!! He asks.
Answer them!
No, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't frown.
Do you know the door I entered through?
No, no
No falcon.
Alas, Saad.
Manar, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share of the company and properties, we have no objection.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure he's her evil husband.
Because she is kind.
As if I'm begging them.
It's a well-known and legally binding law.
He tells me it's either six hundred thousand or nothing.
Not fair
Expect anything, Manira!
My father's company.
Eight buildings
Without mentioning lands and houses
He says only six hundred thousand.
With the signing of the renunciation document
No oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign the paper, be careful, I warn you.
It's your right to know everything about land, money, and everything else, not theirs.
But the company,
You are a partner.
They just fired you from the company.
No one can stop me.
Do you know what?
Is it your father's company?
You don't see him screaming.
Let me show you in. I'll tell you.
Leave it, it's not needed.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's shouting at us, make him stop.
We are sorry.
My brother Saad went to the office and explained to them, they don't know.
Come inside.
See if Mr. Nasser would like to drink something.
Please, come in.
Certainly %pw
You're going to get us into trouble.
He's discovering how much she has.
He's going to find out that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's calculate it.
In ninety-six months
Here's the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million five hundred twenty thousand
No problem, what's next?
Let him do what he can.
I'll tell him frankly.
Our money
All the people who inherited together.
Hello, welcome to your company, ignore what happened.
You are most welcome.
Here is the accountant, Sami.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser wants to know.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come in, please do, no need to ask permission.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
Go to him, take it.
Let him see all the files.
It is supposed to take more than ten million.
They didn't even mention that.
She used to say she was poor.
Her father left.
Four buildings
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is larger than the second one.
God suffices us for everything, He is the Protector, my son.
It's not fair what they're doing.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Um Slemin?
I have to sue them; there's no other option.
He quickly glances through a few papers.
The case was adjourned.
Be careful, my son! Oh, Nasser.
Don't mention anything about the court.
Madam, you are here and the doctor is looking for you.
Rise, O Mother of Salmin.
Go to your room.
And all the Muslim patients
What he told me
Sorry, who's speaking?
Ah, now I remember, yes, yes, I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
For anything, my brother!
Never mind, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's going crazy.
Do you think that this Abdullah whom I sent to them can...
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He has known him well for years past.
Do you believe Manira?
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
Chase them upstairs.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to get as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
Not for people who live seventy or eighty years,
It's for people who live at least two hundred years.
Mother of Muslims, may Allah have mercy on her.
Rest in peace, she used to say
Our population has reached four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years or more.
Do they have to *mummify us* to consult the court?
This is he.
Yes, dear, are you sitting with them?
Good luck.
By the way, he's an old school friend.
Life is short.
And I seek your benefit.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
It is deeply rooted.
Please, Rashid, we're friends.
Please go while you're still calm.
Or you'll get beaten.
Go far away, forget about the topic of friendship.
Are you going out or what?
I paid one hundred and ninety thousand riyals for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibition.
Where did she get all this money from?
They waste money on their wives.
And she deprives her sisters of her wealth.
Do you still have hope, Nasser!
They killed you with you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you to do.
Well-known and deeply rooted people
Possible, why not
But, I also suggest
God bless these words from these shining faces.
O Allah, enlighten our hearts with that which is beneficial for our life in this world and the Hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say, it's not a problem for my sister's share.
Correct
It's better for you to go, or you'll get beaten.
What matters to me is what you say.
I asked you for months, and you refused.
What matters to me.
I tomorrow morning
Give it to me.
Hello, hello.
Do not listen to her.
You're not going to court.
The day after tomorrow
We'll give you a chance to see what you do.
Goodbye
Being nice doesn't work with them.
And they realized that their reputation was threatened.
Let's see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow so we can go see her tomorrow.
What is this?
You're right.
You asked why.
You want to go to court and ruin our reputation.
In order to receive your share of the inheritance
Yes, I did that.
I hope your life is beautiful.
I hope your life is perfect.
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
When you get there, first park your car in the parking lot.
You'll see the security guards.
Go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Business cards of all the lawyers in the country
I'm sure you'll need them.
Come here, you're laughing at us.
They want her to initiate legal proceedings against us.
Go to the court.
Listen to Manar.
Sign the waiver for us.
"Good" or "The good" (depending on context)
You know the way.
We showed you the way.
Come on, brother.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is today's newspaper, Al Raya.
In an excellent article
A woman wrote it, I think she's a doctor.
I want you to leave, as a gift *from me*.
His living conditions need to change.
Alas!
He has four children, but his house is miserable.
Certainly he will be, risking all his wealth.
Take a risk on this project.
The last person I expected to start a project with is Bu Waleed.
Eat, eat, sons of the new merchant, Abu Waleed.
My love, do you want me to get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, take some fruits for yourself.
Mom, I want Hamood's toy.
Bon appétit, bon appétit
Walid, give your uncle some candy.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Waleed. You deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
Oh daddy, when we become big merchants, I want to have my own private room.
See what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Present, I'll get you a large-sized BlackBerry.
Forget their wishes now.
Like all people
Instead of our small and miserable house
First, let's pay off all our debts, and then we'll see.
You look very happy, Bou Walid.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, his luck is good.
All my hair, oh merchant father.
Blessings to the project.
Leave some for my friends.
God willing, may God bless you.
I met a Japanese man, I was among them.
When we were seated, he swapped places with me, giving me a catalog as a gift.
Later, one of my friends saw her.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
"It's always like this."
They are computer labs.
Press the cinema.
If you want the field...
This is magic.
They were amazed; they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, and some of my relatives, I sold my land, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has agreed,
Why didn't you ask for it earlier, even though the ministry approved it?
And then, an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
There is thyme tea.
No problem, I'm still waiting at Ali's office.
And the secretary didn't call, brother.
And be away for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Aren't you a fully accredited manager?
Why don't you go get him to sign it for you?
I told you he can't.
Not just him, all the staff there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving sometimes.
You must thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Finished?
How can I finish this while Abu Fahd never leaves?
What can I do?
After that, I will lose my money.
I want him to sign as soon as possible to get it over with, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
You say that he, while being your secretary, betrayed us.
And give me your mobile number.
She is the secretary. Please sit down, go on, sit down. It's him, what's wrong with you?
Don't call, you're scaring people, they thought it was the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Bu Fahad.
%pw, my money for bathroom maintenance
He is stupid.
Oh people, wait, wait
Okay, okay.
He told you to stay calm, enough, be quiet.
Bu Fahad had to go to the airport.
How did he leave?
Let's see him at the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
God helps you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear.
But his behavior is strange.
And if he does not receive the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs him.
Where is he now?
What do you want to search for?
He is here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Oh brother, I told you.
I told you.
This is beyond my control, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but it's not fair.
The semester will start next week at the university.
If I don't enroll, I'll have to wait until the next semester.
Three months would be a waste of time.
My beloved, I am trying.
Don't you think I go to the ministry every day?
Wait until Bou Fahd comes, Bou Fahd.
And I stay at home.
I don't understand!
Don't call during lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
But, God willing, Abu Fahd will sign the papers this week.
And they will give him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
He wakes up in a state of panic.
He walks and talks to himself all night long while sleeping.
If Bu Fahad hadn't signed,
God helps him.
Therefore,
Bu Fahad needs to sign this paper this week.
What's he waiting for?
He comes to work once.
And he traveled for a year.
And He left the comfort of the people.
Oh oh oh oh oh, how did this happen?
Do you feel better now?
Tear me apart from within.
This unusual fever drags me, pulls me.
What does he want?
I heard I'm going to the ministry.
To process my paperwork
He told the staff that he would discipline me.
The time period is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
He is Bu Fahd's secretary.
I'd like to tell you that
Abu Fahd will come tomorrow, God willing.
Whenever I call you,
Come directly.
Hello
You were never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on the screen of your mobile phone.
I said it's a pity.
Until you feel responsible
And if you commit yourself
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printing paper
Fifteen boxes of printer paper
He is poor.
The manager punishes him.
By bringing him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He's going to lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes, the manager will find out.
Please, oh please, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
I'll take care of it, just let it go.
Bu Waleed
I'm going, but I'm waiting for a phone call.
Tell me
God helps him.
Wait, people, wait, people, wait
How am I supposed to know where he's going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
We are going to look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Street by street
It seems
Call the hospital quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I have spent my entire life as a messenger, for many years, until today.
A long time, O Abu Saeed.
What were you thinking about?
About fourteen years.
Sent
This headache
And the heat without air conditioning in past years.
Did you think riding a bike was ever easy?
With a yellow sign.
It was a very difficult time, O Abu Saeed.
Oh, sorrow, my son.
But what can we do, son of Adam?
Bu Saad
Alright, sorry guys, the manager has arrived as he said he would. Let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived. Oh! Beautiful, let's go.
Congratulations, Abu Saeed.
They said your son, Khalid, was an employee.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.
Pigeon thief
I told you when my last son graduates, I'll quit.
Graduated and found a job.
Alhamdulillah, I'm about to finish my work.
You served correctly.
Praise be to God.
Change your opinion, Abu Saeed.
And you deserve it.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz!
I am truly grateful, Abu Abdulaziz.
Are you?
We did our duty.
Let them finish the trip.
Your right
After all this age and work
Means all this back and forth rushing.
You need to rest, Abu Saeed.
After I leave here, my wife calls me.
Celebrating my retirement
A coffee pot and some dates, how wonderful.
When will we finish, my son?
You're in a hurry because of the khunfush, Abu Saeed.
Don't worry.
Ready-made thief
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the unicorn is ready, waiting for me.
I will now complete all your papers.
This is your chance to introduce him today.
He told me that their manager would travel.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't even want to move.
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye.
Congratulations to me.
No work now.
That means you're free, dad.
Present, if you please, Father.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zohra is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
She brought a cake.
I can't.
I've already sent my father to finish some papers for me.
Zahara will be sad.
Okay, Mom.
My father finished his shift.
God helps him now.
He's worked enough, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook some khane frash.
I prepared it.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
It's your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
You made this old man tired.
As soon as he came back,
I was tired.
Don't bother me about their singing.
Don't bother me about their singing.
I wanted to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said that he would punish anyone who was late.
Of course, my dear.
Go to your work.
On this nose, and those small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
He sends you to a place every day.
As you wish, Um Saeed.
Smell
In my nose
Khanafresh Khanafresh
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, dad, take it to the market branch.
And go there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me he's not here.
Okay, goodbye.
I got sunstroke.
The sun is beating down.
I entered our neighbors' house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what's wrong with me.
What power makes you do this?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat Khanfroush now.
Mom, where's Dad?
Back and forth
What bank did she tell him to go to?
They told him that some of the papers were missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the director.
How is my father now, is he better?
I slept a bit, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave your father, let him rest.
Are they miserable, or happy?
They have to commit to their work, they are being evaluated, what are they doing?
As you like it.
Father of the Hawk
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
How does that mean?
Before, in the past
Misery is written for me.
Your children are adults.
I need to help them.
They used to tell me
You are wrong.
Do you think that all fatherless young people don't finish their personal tasks?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they allow you to leave to finish your personal business.
May God reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the coffee shop behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shahin?
I'll finish some papers for my son, Saeed.
In this ministry, next to this coffee shop
I'll take him to the Land Office.
Goodbye
What's up, Mom? Okay, see you later, goodbye.
This won't do you any good.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
What matters to me about you.
If your father doesn't complain
He is silent.
And what they speak about
You've tired him out, fear God.
Your very loud screaming woke me up.
Dad, you were a government employee and know well the meaning of hoarding.
And they write this first.
And now they are %pw, doing this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Present, my son.
You believed his lies.
He says he has a sock committee meeting tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
%pw, as you wish
Go now to finish your work.
There's nothing, there's nothing.
He's been quiet since he came back home.
That's what replies to me.
You have no dignity at all.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree to this
Often, and may Allah reward you with good.
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he yelling at his servant?
You are the most respected among us, Father!
I'm grateful to you.
Please forgive him.
Let me punish him.
From now on, father.
And relax.
Khanfaresh Khanfaresh (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, Father.
May God reward you with good.
We've decided from now on,
We'll write our papers ourselves.
Thank you very much to everyone, may God reward you, praise be to God.
But please, Father!
Consider it the last.
But I can't.
They just called me now.
Father, I'm not going to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister is upset with you.
No, no, no, that's not how it works. You can't upset the minister. You have to go, even before him.
My father is gone, what should I say, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, consider it done.
He will be on his way once you finish Saeed's papers.
Please, Dad.
Consider it the last leaf you finish for me.
I am happy to serve you, father.
But your son is supposed to sign this paper.
Do you mean I should come back to give it to you tomorrow?
I advise you to return it today.
And when they see the papers
You'll have to wait for two months.
Don't give it to me to sign and return to you.
No, no, no, there's no need.
Just call him and tell him to come, just two minutes.
I'll finish it.
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Every time I ask my friend, "Where are you?"
He says he's with Saeed.
I'm waiting until the work day is over.
All right, man.
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you send your children?
Don't you have any children?
Are you alright, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
No use.
I'm going to leave you.
And go to the geriatric clinic.
I want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you going to tell them, Abu Saeed?
I'll write something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He came from yesterday's generation.
I'm really sorry, sister.
Why are you exhausting yourself?
I told him never to appear on television or radio.
These "stop corruption" conversations got us into trouble.
May God guide him to the right path.
Okay, sister, goodbye, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was far away.
What can I tell you?
He called the program called MyLas, I think.
He spoke with the boy.
What is referred to as Khalid Jassem
He told him to stop corrupting.
His colleagues heard him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who were encouraging him to do that,
He left it.
May God guide him to the straight path.
Sorry, I have to go cook now.
Hello anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and bored of this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mother.
Sorry to hear that happened.
I told you about this.
What is this, Mom?
And he screamed.
This commitment
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
Just don't talk about him.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
That's unfortunate, after all these years, you're firing me.
You don't listen.
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes, a weapon.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
Well-informed
We just separated a bit.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye.
Brother Saleh
I hope your uncle, Manira's father, didn't find out.
He's really mad at you.
Who is the one who knows him?
If someone asks you
Tell him I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he's still working.
Of course
His mother has to say today that
What can we do with him now?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
No matter what I see, I am right.
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court for the divorce of my daughter.
Drink your coffee.
You're only hesitating because you have something on your mind.
Frankly
My father went outside.
You are grounded.
I know you're very excited about
Go to the coffee shop.
To talk nonsense
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
If God wills, I will wake up early.
Oh mother, I told you, I've broken that habit.
I swear
Oh mother, frankly, I feel a bit bored.
And don't talk nonsense.
Act like you're deaf.
It is a change.
What's wrong with you, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear some of your conversations about stopping corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Is Saleh here!
He must be sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
We just saw him at the coffee shop.
What did he say?
He did the right thing.
Because there were a lot of people around him.
Just call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it's not your fault,
It's wrong of him not to stop you.
I know you very well.
You're like someone who has just quit smoking.
Do you speak or not, whether to stop corruption talks or not.
I warn you.
If I hear you speaking on a radio program.
Stop corruption, Saleh.
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have high patriotism.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
Excuse us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I hope you didn't go to the trouble of coming, we appreciate it.
I'm actually
I miss hearing her every day, stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Please say it, just once.
God bless you, I
Is it a cigarette? Just say stop corruption, please.
He's begging you, help him just once, just this once.
This is amazing.
Now, my dear
Regarding the job
You are a loyal citizen, and very dear to us.
We wanted to talk to you to inform you.
He could have exposed you in front of people.
Are you serious?
They all said there were no vacancies.
They really wanted me, but there were no openings.
Now, how are you going to save money for yourself and your mother?
And don't forget that.
And she has four children.
God helps you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You need to look for a job every day.
So my father won't get angry
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I will never say stop corruption again.
Stop corruption.
You don't know what he's doing these days.
I told you.
But you, you never listen to me.
May God guide us and guide you.
I can't go to the minister and tell him about what this man is doing.
The minister is thinking.
Surely he thinks about her like this.
You're right.
But it's a serious matter.
We need to do something.
They say he's replacing you, you know, this rumor is very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind them.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh stopping corruption?
He lives in my neighborhood.
He will take care of that.
We miss your voice.
No good
And I am one of your biggest fans.
Salih is a very kind man.
And God willing, soon.
He'll be back, and we'll enjoy hearing his voice.
Even Bou Fahad himself asks about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you resign?
I faced some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly
You are diligent.
It's been a long time since I heard from her.
How wonderful, please reconcile.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about it.
Salih says he agrees.
No, people, it's really hard.
What's wrong?
Men are begging you.
Abdulrahman, I had already stopped.
You didn't tell us you were looking for a job?
Well, this is your chance.
Make him happy and let him hear your voice, then go to him the next day and ask him for a job.
He's definitely going to speed up on you.
I want what's best for you.
Know what?
Forget about it, go home.
No, no, no, we no longer want to help you.
Present, wait a minute, let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Okay, okay.
Well, if I speak for the last time now, I would stop but I'll do it one last time.
What does Bu Fahd want to hear?
What's the problem that concerns him the most? You know, there are a lot of problems here, many.
What does he like to listen to? Not the commotion, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
87 bear = centimeter
He messed it up.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is the seventh edition? The seventh.
Don't interrupt me.
Volume VII, The Minister
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
His brother's cars are answered.
Oh people, stop corrupting.
Since you're back, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
I am from a proud people, meaning, this is the last time.
Because frankly, I had stopped.
Oh Mother, you said he resigned, and you fired him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man who is referred to as the corruption stopper, spoke about it on the radio.
I didn't hear it, but some people told me that he...
I'm sure someone from the ministry exposed it.
Get rid of it.
He is free.
Alright, Your Excellency the Minister
Don't worry.
My whole day is dedicated to serving the ministry, God bless you.
Did you hear that?
I only said it for you.
Ignore me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdel Rahman told me he was going to hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are very poor, Saleh.
I pity you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the problem.
They used you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they reached him.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
He was behind all of that.
Bu Fahad will never hire you.
You're doing the same thing to him.
As long as you're known.
No one is going to hire you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow for divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, not at all.
We never have problems.
We are happy.
What is nepotism?
Everyone stands in line.
Because that's the system here.
He gets more rights than a foreigner.
We do not rely on foreigners.
We don't have that.
Your efforts and work make you the best; we don't have any problems.
Or an important officer
And I send you
We don't have this here.
With my regards
Salih Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahri
Known for stopping corruption.
I don't want to have dinner.
I was running and someone grabbed and tore my shirt.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Walid saw you wearing the shirt we just bought from Villaggio.
He envied him, tore him to pieces.
He's kind-hearted, he can't scold him.
I believe
You, Adoul, saw my child handsome and started to envy him.
It's not my right.
Why did you let Walid take off his shirt?
You saw him wearing a new shirt and started to feel jealous, ask your father to buy you a new one.
What do you think of yourself?
Why did you cut Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you
Don't assume I'll hit you.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you do it again and hit him in the face and disfigure him?
He's a little kid, not your age, shame on you.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
He needs people to lift him up and fix him.
Not just the left.
Watch your words, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, to fix me.
You are arrogant.
Raise your child well.
And if you cannot do that
I respect him.
I don't want to scold him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Adol returns to hit Waleed again.
I'll punish him.
It's me who wastes my time arguing with you.
Act yourself.
Let me go and show her.
Argue with fools
Where are the days that have gone?
And the intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this is the biggest one.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the problem we're in.
What's wrong, my love? Tell me what happened.
My brother Ahmed, sorry, I have to go home, there's something urgent and I need to go.
Adoul's pants are gone.
He is a resentful person, tired of hatred.
It's... It's Sultan.
How did the child cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I didn't use them, God is sufficient.
I'll show him.
Sit down, listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't confess. He'll say the child did it.
"Prevalence of equality"
Walid, do you know how to ride a bicycle?
Yes, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
Where did you put the scissors, dear?
Under his bed.
They destroyed it, may God destroy their lives.
But I'll show him.
I will not be silent.
He is crazy, insane.
Now
And do not change it.
But the computer is another matter, I'll show it to him.
I will not be silent.
Do you think our son Adoul is the one who damaged their computer?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this.
No *
Go and play with someone else, maybe your friends, not me.
I told you it's Advil.
And you laugh at someone else, oh! Foxes, not me.
Aisha, come here please.
The hearts were kind.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I don't go looking for friends.
He laughs at me, not I, oh! Sultan.
I am falsely accused.
Hold these scissors.
Act yourself.
Hello, Abdurrahman, come quickly, son!
Come and see your brothers, Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, son!
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We must be.
Think carefully about our actions.
And the actions of those who came before us.
We see,
It's going to be a lesson for us.
We must learn from them.
Don't act like children.
It is the size of a camel.
Do you have children?
Without knowledge
You are his role model, not them.
This model is his father.
You, O Sultan!
And you, Fahd!
And I am your older brother.
To me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
He sucked his hand.
You haven't forgiven each other.
No, he just sucked it with his hand so I could escape.
From Abdulrahman's never-ending story
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave it.
Did you make that tea?
Get out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Did I say Abdurrahman made peace between you?
But, I swear if he calms down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
I'll show him, hold the tea.
On his head
Quiet, quiet, stop it you guys, they have no shame, hitting each other.
You're acting like little children, stop it, son!
I swear to you that I'll show you.
Hit it, hit it, oh boy, what a big owl.
Blood, oh mother
You scared me with your screaming.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
Alas!
Even though I reconciled you both.
I won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile them
He didn't have time, my daughter!
"God is my witness against him."
Inshallah
He speaks fluently.
But, girls!
May God guide us and guide you.
You must calm them down.
Don't incite them to fight each other, girls.
What happened? I hope it's nothing bad.
You've lost me, Abdel Rahman.
I wanted you to help, not do the same thing.
You are the wise brother, my son. May God guide you.
Two strikes in a row.
Extend your hand.
You've embarrassed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Officer, we've told him repeatedly.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were stoning, the three of them.
Excuse me.
No *
Believe me, officer, I saw them from *my window*.
Did you hear him?
It means it's too far away.
My brother was right when he said that.
I'm sorry, but now that you've signed that your children won't do it again,
Thank you, thank you.
Hello, brother, hello
Officer, how are you going to release them, I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say this in front of them.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Deputy Assistant Under Secretary
Al-Wusta is the chairperson of a public authority.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Panadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
God protect us from the enemy.
God is sufficient against the enemy.
God protects me from the evil of the enemy, they have tired me out.
What is this? What's the percentage of pw?
A child could throw that far!
This is an adult hand, it seems to be his father's.
Do you believe that?
He seems to be from a respectable family, kind and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
Spread
He follows you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say you didn't have the opportunity.
When I passed by, she looked at you, what does that mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You moved your head, and she moved hers at the same time.
No, but there must be something.
I notice when you enter.
You feel she's happy, from the bottom of her heart.
Go ask her about the pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than it should be.
Come on, man, we're in the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly
It's been a long time since we sat and talked like this.
No, this is the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
But you need to go and rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were exhausted, the hours were long, I told the secretary I didn't want any press or TV interviews, no contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
God helps you.
Even when you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have the owner's number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa is now sold, and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with series and filming.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them, we will not interfere.
Good morning, uncle.
What's wrong?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems the battery is the problem.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May God reward you with good.
At any time, uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Okay, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby to visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Alright, enough already, man.
Take it.
What is your full name?
Rashid Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
The neighbor precedes the house.
I want to take a picture with him.
So my colleagues will believe me.
He couldn't believe our house was next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's.
Talk to him so he believes you.
What a life!
What we used to see him do on TV.
And I hope to see him.
Our neighbor, praise God, oh my God!
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but oh! People, go easy on me, I'm still not quite used to it.
I heard about him.
That was very kind of him, may God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
It was confirmed that some employees will be transferred to the ministry's new branch in Dukhan.
Did they tell you who was moving?
I didn't hear their names.
But, what I heard and am sure of
Is Bou Ali among them?
My name!
But, we don't exactly know who we're translating for.
I can't go, God bless you, smoke is too far away from me, I can't.
Whether you can or you can't, it's still work, man.
The committee is still studying the issue.
But if they choose you
Thank you for visiting me, Abu Waleed, please have some.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali!
Please forgive us, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We're like family.
That's very kind of you, Abu Walid.
May God reward you with good, Abu Waleed.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God keep this love forever.
But, oh! My daughter.
I'm ready to walk around the market for you until you find beautiful furniture at the best price that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you before.
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
I will never shed a tear for you (proverb).
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Not because it tires you.
There's no more.
I'll call you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing compared to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Wait a little bit.
Wait a little bit.
And I give you the green light to propose to her on my behalf.
I told you.
No, Mother, don't cry.
And you come and ask me to give you the show.
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you want to have dinner.
The driver is taking her to the university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
Whose car is this, then?
And God willing, soon.
I called to thank her.
Good people, they love good.
Yes, you are right, father.
Even our relatives wouldn't do that for us.
Sure! Is my name mentioned?
Are you sure?
What a problem! Why do problems keep chasing us?
I don't know, now I'm confused. I heard this news, what should I do, I don't know.
Come on, come on, come on, let's go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
What happened, Abu Ali!
The committee met today.
And the list of names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is mentioned.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, oh! Mother Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, he told me it's impossible.
Famous actor
Consider your name was never on the list.
May God bless you, thank you very much, Abu Salem.
If you don't mind.
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Sure, God bless you.
Come please, come.
Of course, I'm happy to help you.
You and those you love
Let me know a day or two in advance.
Mom, get ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
Are you crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said, "I don't have a problem."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
But, my son!
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
You have to keep up with the fashion trends.
I don't have any chic dresses.
You got me into trouble.
Why are you taking out all this gold? This is the first time I've seen you do this.
It's not to me.
Mother of Ali
Umm Ali will suggest to her son.
She wants some stylish clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and wealthy people.
(Surprise) God willing
She's lucky.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She's taller and blonder.
Inshallah, I hear.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You need to be ready too.
They're going to ask you to meet her father.
I'm not going in these clothes.
When will I put on my new clothes?
Mother, take care of her belongings.
It's very kind of Wael's mother to give you her things, so use them carefully.
Yes yes
So I have to be like them.
Why didn't his mother go to propose to him?
That was for the women.
I have to go and meet the men.
As you can see, God blesses you.
Just the six of us left, God bless you.
Kind people, they helped me.
They were helpful, only the pashtun cap is left.
Dad, can I borrow it from you to complete the look?
Everyone stands for you.
Oh, brother Rashid, should I just let it go like this, or should I hold on to it?
No, see, first
You need to press this button.
He's holding me captive.
The garment (men's robe) is loose, but
God bless you.
The left hand needs to be in.
The right hand is relaxed, so is the left.
You hold the lower coat.
Wow, wow
How wonderful!
Your steps need to slow down a bit.
Ah! %pw, eh?
Now you look like a millionaire.
What they gave you, okay, seconds
Put your left hand, like this, your left hand, this way.
Do you know my friend, Aisha?
What's her situation?
Do you know what she was telling me today a little while ago?
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to be apart."
I'll ask my brother to ask you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and put him and her in an awkward position.
I see many suitors are interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Saud wanted you for her uncle, and today, this one wants you for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
I'm just sitting and watching.
Do they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
Okay, then.
From tomorrow, they need to know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I am screaming.
You reject my son Waleed.
The actors are more honest than you, O two-faced one!
But you,
They work all their lives.
This doesn't reflect your personality.
To serve people
Lying to people
Wear costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while performing a role on television.
Me or you!
You're wearing accessories, gold, and jewelry.
Plays
You are getting married.
Any scene
A man walks in front of his wife.
He is wearing the gutra over the sides of his face.
Whatever way he turns his face, neither right nor left.
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
God helps him, man.
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the look of the city center.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't look good when you're sitting.
You look better when you breathe, why do you, do, do
I'm begging you, Thursday!
What's up, are you going to the city center?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife is annoying him.
Are you happy about that!
* O Thursday
Engage it, and if the presenter is female.
I change the channel because I'm afraid it will get me into trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker.
Talk to her.
She hung up on me, take it, take it.
I cut the line, now it's going to cause me problems.
Now you're saying I made you talk to her because there's a woman with us.
Now you can throw me out of the house.
Get out!
You're not the first to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, oh! Brother!
I don't want to trouble my mother in her grave.
Trust me.
She said, "Don't shoot."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, please stay, stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem is particularly one of the best men in our city.
He is asking you for a divorce.
Even if he asked me for a divorce, would I be stupid to divorce him? It's unbelievable.
Thursday, I officially went crazy.
Leave me alone, please.
I was talking to him, by myself.
May God guide us and guide you.
The poor man is very painful to the heart.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to, may God guide you?
No, no, nothing, nothing.
Give it to me, I'll take it to him.
Regarding the meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you sleeping today?
Hello, Salem
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm talking to you with genuine awareness.
Oh brother!
Remove my name, so I won't be present.
How can we delete your name?
The only one who can erase your name is His Excellency, the Minister.
It's a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Hello Hello Hello
Tell me the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Safety, safety, safe, I swear he was safe.
If you were talking to Salem
Will you speak louder?
This lie won't work.
Don't lie, you scoundrel!
You're not telling the truth!
You're wearing casual clothes.
She thought I was talking to a woman.
What an unfortunate life.
God bless you, please call Salem.
Please, just believe.
He asked you to call.
None of your business.
Don't meddle in others' affairs, or you'll face something unpleasant.
And she complains about you.
Hello!? You!
How can you live with a woman who has such a sharp tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hasan is going to call Thursday.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's start
Let's hope he finds it.
He was terrified when he saw the women.
I searched the entire ministry and you were hiding here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the conference room.
I can't sit with the girls.
Oh Thursday, how do you know your wife?
I'm afraid she'll call.
Oh my God, you want her to suspect me, don't you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Will your wife call at this hour!
Of course, since your company is large.
This project, which your company will implement for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh people, why is the table shaking?
No, I'm the one with a long life, not the table, I am.
Can you return your call?
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to speak to?
My phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He fainted because he was scared to go home.
Her brother came.
He told him that his wife said not to come home unless he changed his job and didn't work with women.
That's why I sent a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it. What more does he want!
What's his problem with his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him: Who are you talking to?
I told you he's crazy.
What are you doing! Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
As long as you did what she wanted, why are you afraid to go home and see your kids?
She wants official proof.
Okay, give her the papers.
Well, this is what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
To make sure she sees the minister's signature and verifies it.
And God willing, we'll agree. If you agree, God willing, I'll be back home tonight.
Sister, here is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
He will start working in the new department tomorrow.
Which means an office and a job, different from the one he used to work in before.
Where is this section, may God bless you?
Yes, God bless you, this is the minister's permission.
Nothing, nothing, there it is, on your right.
Yes, password, God bless you.
Here you go, your office is ready.
Saad, and Abdul Qadir, God willing, it's a big office, yes.
Goodbye
Why are you asking for a transfer?
The whole department is women.
My wife
No one can issue a second decree except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Brother, make a deal with your colleagues.
And let them address them by men's names, so your wife won't know.
And I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office referred a man to work with us.
Are you serious!
It seems funny, poor guy, a man working among five women, it seems funny.
They say his wife is very jealous of other women around him.
Blind jealousy
The poor man is in need.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife called, so we complied and didn't speak.
Ah, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
***** See if it fits you.
My son called, said my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Walk straight, it's the first floor on your left.
This is in the welfare office.
With the fifth ***
These are six employees.
And here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't work on me.
My wife is jealous of other women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
"May God guide us, O Sultan."
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
My uncle, Saqr, and I were at the bank yesterday.
The project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed and ready to go.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
And scorpion bites are painful.
This is important for rain, see see.
Look, uncle.
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
The meeting is scheduled to be rescheduled for tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
They always give orders.
And we must apply.
They must realize that you are an important supervisor.
I have many responsibilities and commitments.
They consider women as servants.
I've never seen people hate women as much as they do.
What age do they think they're living in?
They told me not to go to work today, but instead go to the kitchen and make tea.
Where are the servants?
And another one escaped a week ago.
Even the maids couldn't bear their insults.
I understand them.
God helps you.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
My uncle, they mean that.
In fact, the villa complex is nothing without a garden.
Present now, the park..
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
My love, Fatoum, I have to go, I'm late.
Alright, tell me, what's up?
Speak or I'll leave.
Playing in school.
A committee from the Women's League came today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league.
If you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good.
You're the one who bears the responsibility.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and see me, it's been a long time since I last saw you.
A year has passed now, a year since I saw you.
Is he married yet?
"O Allah, guide us."
Who would agree to marry someone whose mother has no certificate?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if my mother is a man.
And Thursday is the son of snakes.
Her sting (scorpion sting) is painful.
And he also needs to marry someone from the same social status.
A scorpion like him.
God helps you.
What can I do, Aisha!
Ever since the minister traveled, all the papers have been referred to me.
I informed Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I want to meet with him tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
Do you have the schedule?
And now I'm free to talk to you, Aisha.
Yes, Mary.
Okay, I'm coming, okay, I'm on my way now.
What can I say, Aisha!
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
Don't worry, my love. Ice packs are necessary so your face doesn't swell.
We warned her not to go and talk to them about it.
She went to them, and they beat her.
Do you know if I tell them it's a football?
They had already beaten you a long time ago.
Oh no, you play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
The Big Scorpion
That little one
Come on, man, I didn't hit her, it was the sultan who did it.
Did you hear that?
I chose economics and politics.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's your turn.
You had your chance.
Don't be greedy.
Okay, scorpion.
Hit her and break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Go to the scholarship office.
And cancel the architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and I will read.
They don't mind you marrying Munira.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves all good.
I'll arrange a meeting for them and let you know.
Your nomination to be with the delegation.
I appreciate your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
Frankly,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
He is right.
I know my brothers very well.
They never agree.
I am astonished.
Their car loan is paid off with my salary.
I support the household.
She wants me to travel with her.
Aren't we getting married this week?
What are you saying?
Stupid Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Marry and travel with him.
Done, let's go.
This is a major flaw.
They'll kill her if she refuses.
Oh my son, I've told you many times.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I will go tomorrow.
What matters to you, as long as he is the son of scorpions?
Appearance is what matters.
I don't want to marry Thursday.
And go to the kitchen.
And put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona match tonight
I hope Valencia doesn't overcome us.
My sources are reliable.
She is loyal and hardworking.
What's your opinion on this matter?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please, go to your offices.
Thank you, may God prolong your life.
Long life
They serve coffee there.
The esteemed presence
May God prolong her life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Your Excellency the Ambassador.
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go and pour coffee for Captain Emad.
And also
We're going to play in China after tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister, Mary.
I'm going to the official engagement party.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw.
Yes, ma'am.
Pour it and make a new one.
Actors' conversations
You know, later Mishaal called me a moment ago.
What can I say to her?
Unfortunately, Nouf's role isn't suitable for Mashael.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And Mashael appears to be in her twenties.
Well, why doesn't Mary take over the role?
Suits her better.
"Nouf for thirty"
We need to get rid of the annoying person on the committee.
He's a problem. I'm sure he won't let things run smoothly.
He is precise.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, and more.
Who chose him for this committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
I, you, and Hadi can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
There's nothing to indicate that it's ours.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company is registered in the name of Hamed's wife, God bless you.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, man, everything is fine, come in.
I just got in touch with them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve the series "Conscientious Extortion" or not.
It is produced by the Modern Touches Institute of Arts.
It's a beautiful, unconventional, and bold action series.
I agree with Hamed.
The storyline of the series is very sweet.
I agree with you.
I liked it when she took the weapon and killed her neighbor.
She wanted to hide the weapon, so she put it in the car.
And she didn't know that it was for her son, it was exciting, and when the police came
Her children come from school.
And kicked the box.
Kick it and it flies into his mother's window.
Here's the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
It's good that a local company produces this advanced level of output.
We need to encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and thoughts on the series, this is "blackmail of the conscience."
Blackmailing human values
Disgusting surprises
One and a half people per episode
The other text is left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
What carries a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears fall, why do you have to make the audience cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
You've given us your opinion, Ali has given us his opinion, let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
Clear from the meeting.
There is an agreement between you both.
I organized it.
Some people understand, and this is their field, others have nothing to do with the field.
I reject this series.
I'm afraid he'll get us into trouble.
Ignore him.
What can he do? He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Madame Samira.
I don't know what to do.
How true! O Nasser
This is for the new series we'll be producing soon.
What makes the driver rape the girl?
For the blessings we received because of him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
They're presenting it in the name of Hamed's wife. Who sent you the ring?
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
Nice turn
I just played a similar role, didn't you see "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
It's called blackmail or something like that, I can't remember.
Yes, extorting dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
Last year's TV series were all about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your place is guaranteed.
You are very beloved.
You're lucky.
Yes, Omar.
Yes, okay, fine.
Sorry, my love. I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
Just eat and walk.
He said he wanted to see me about a very important and urgent matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
He told him that he would tire him out.
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called and they're going to meet me.
I'm also afraid the minister will believe him.
I'm going to meet the minister.
The man came to explain his point of view about the series.
This is all.
This is true, may you live longer.
But first, Your Excellency, I would like to say that it is unacceptable to talk about your colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He's jealous of everyone around him.
He only cares about the financial benefit.
But it's his specialty.
But, God bless you, not every educated person can handle these technical matters.
Special Television Productions
Conscience blackmail, the series we're working on.
It's massive productivity.
We have a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, this is your specialty. You know more about this than I do.
I promise you a wonderful series.
He's going to stand with our name.
Look and see what the journalist Abdel Hamid wrote, listen listen.
Also, one of the actors said
That the series promotes immoral ideas.
This is limited by the decline of literature.
This is indeed a bold and powerful criticism.
They will be in big trouble if journalist Abdul Hamid continues writing about them.
And if the people I am responsible for know about this.
But they are sharp, they know how to handle him.
They are grunge.
We need to create our own website.
All our company's activities are focused on him.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The series supervised by Mercury Media Production is considered one of
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because he carries moral values and ideas.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
He's the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept this?
The journalist Abdelhamid and others like him
Don't worry, Mr. Hamed.
He asked me, "What do you think of the series?" I told him, "It's going to be the best in the Arab world."
I hope so.
I feel like our next series is going to be awesome.
I don't know where he is.
The second one packs and is ready to go.
Not an interesting beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
Clear at first glance
Your book is stupid.
It's possible.
Your serial is stupid, stupid.
What do you think?
It's very tragic.
Other bad series are no excuse.
I can grasp this production at first sight.
These are hidden lines and dimensions, one needs to focus to discover them.
By the way, it's a political drama.
It's a pity that he was seen.
What's wrong?
I wasn't this nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif yesterday with Ali.
We were at a café.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? The minister is angry, this is a big problem.
Within a week, we'll all be fired.
What a failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him that the serial is a failure and there is no action in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Listen, Ellie!
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Ellie, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production but also cursed it.
Don't make me angry.
Sorry
That day I was absent.
I never let them write this.
But frankly, I haven't received any praise messages.
Once again, a great success.
Goodbye
Brother Rashid,
Am I supposed to believe you or the newspapers?
Blackmail is the best TV show.
May your life be long, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I was about to have a heart attack.
After a while, they told me.
Congratulations to you, the minister is pleased.
Frankly, Nasser,
Get ready to watch Conscience Exortion II
No, no, no, no, enough, brother!
The chain, he said he wouldn't write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All These Problems
Third and fourth also
What's wrong with you? Don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What can a magician do?
I wish you more success.
Please share your thoughts on this success.
I thank God for this success.
They are jealous and envious of our success.
I find it strange.
This series wins awards while being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They awarded her the prizes; they must see what we don't see.
Prepare the second part of the series.
Present, may your life be long.
A real wizard.
You'll see, "blackmail of conscience" will
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
TV festivals lie too!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
They are taken to the bank to be washed and become clean.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series you watch.
They compete in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it and award it, so people consider it high-class.
Yes, that's correct.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God for your arrival.
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We are not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't reduce it.
Otherwise, we will terminate the contract.
We signed the contract yesterday already.
With the British company.
"A cap and a father"
As you like it.
He did a great job.
It will be the first in the world to produce this product.
He's not just the best bread baker in the world.
I'll tell you.
How can bread be with a stew?
Open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and you might cut your hand.
So he made bread with a zipper.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, this is a pair of pants.
What do you think, actually, this is a bag of bread.
How can we remove this zipper?
If that's the case, he can tell his friend, "I ate two clouds."
Why weren't the Noor Mountains Hospital pastries delivered yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you deliver it yesterday?
The bakers who make it
Once again, he used the bakers.
That's what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know your son loves football.
"So what's the problem if some employees from the company take some time off to have fun with them?"
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven main players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
Team spokesperson
Why are you upset with him?
But things are fine for now. Although the fans are the most important players on the field and they are the twelfth player.
I let you enjoy their company.
We have already signed a contract with the people.
When he first told you he wanted to play football.
He listened to you.
Didn't do anything
No, you're upset with him only because he had some employees play football in front of him and enjoy it.
I said he couldn't take some of the employees.
Even if some of your friends need employees, you can recommend some of them.
Important bakers
Oh, my son, why are you taking the important bakers? This is not right.
Next time, inform me before hiring any employee.
No, no, let Hamdi do this paperwork.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they tell you?
I finished my work, and as I was getting into my car,
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find the goalkeeper and that they have an important match today.
He told us to find a goalkeeper, then we reached the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's suit.
I've never touched a soccer ball.
This case
Impossible
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time with football.
Let me explain.
Dad, you want me to disband and dismantle the team, right?
Yes, that's correct.
Present, father, please, please.
I can't break up the team, tomorrow's the last match.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on your victory.
Congratulations, Mr. Nasser, on your cup victory.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
See, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach has worked hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to everyone, and there will be a party, as promised.
Your father looks happy.
I'm afraid he's just being nice and polite.
Uncle Abu Nasser, firstly, we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For such a great success
God bless you, no, no, no.
There's no picture without a bisht (the traditional Arab cloak for men), wait, wait, hold it.
No, no
He is wearing the bisht.
Your care, attention, and creative insights played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
And the coach's plan.
But, they played five-five-three-two in the final.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, yet Baker's team remained focused and executed beautifully.
And the coach's plan.
"As the first athletes in the International Bakers Team, what advice would you give to the players?"
To infinity
Hello hello
Long life
They are welcome, is Hamad Sultan with them?
Welcome, they can come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, done!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz!
It is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still small.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The motors we use in the factory.
"You se
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
The ball introduced me to him, I mentioned this to him.
I said to him, "Oh! Abu Abdulaziz!"
I've never been interested in football all my life.
What's his relation to you?
The ball was always close to me, but there were fifty centimeters between us.
Has Abu Nasser not arrived yet?
No, he didn't come today either.
There's a seminar on football injuries, he's the platinum sponsor, he has to be there.
You'll see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to convert into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we tend to meet and interview someone in the sports field.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
What's the International Bakeries team, we heard you're doing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
It's a small amount of money, just a million dollars for all this effort.
No, man, be generous.
It's not my mistake, brother Shahin.
My mistake.
What was my mistake?
You told me you needed players for the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices are very high.
So if the player's price is two thousand
For the gulut, it costs three or four million dollars.
I didn't understand, explain it to me.
Receive fax here
And he read it before me when you are with him.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily overcome Billy and Ronaldinho.
But 800,000 is written on it.
Yes, that's correct, God bless you, but a Turkish club set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for one million two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Okay, can we inspect the goods?
He is here.
Leg of the leg
Good, fine.
No, no, no, I can't guarantee that to you.
He is fat, thank God, it's good that he is fat.
This is thin, suitable for the middle.
Musculus adductor
It is the strongest muscle, what use is a player without it?
Thank you.
Tell your driver to take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, what did I say! Automatic
How is that?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yes, we bring them from the forests of Africa.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
"I'm glad, you can take it, do you have a place for it or shall I carry it in the pickup truck?"
When he saw them pressuring us
The forward was asked to play.
"Kakakano makalali dinde, la" translates to "It's not a small thing, indeed." in English.
Ask the defender to play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I love how he runs the game.
This should be on the north road.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's going on? Why are you screaming?
Your stupid son
He's not convinced that the coach isn't an expert in football.
Listen to her, she speaks like Mitsu.
He knows that the attacking player Seloulou Tikawa is a good midfielder, as Ahmed El-Tayeb said.
No one is going to give you a headache.
Stay away from you.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose the game?
The team is supposed to think about changing the plan.
Since the players aren't playing in their positions.
And the player Tekulamakalakolalalo's position is incorrect, he should be moved to his usual place.
Ask the coach to change the...
To dismiss Hboui Malalo
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
This wasn't supposed to happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please postpone these matters until the game is over.
People are watching this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Team Success, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he is the star of the match today.
This coach is stubborn in his opinion.
He says, "Abu Nasser no longer wants you as a coach for his team."
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV and you stay as a reserve player, do what I ask you to do.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow, how can we play without a coach?
What's your father doing?
Enough, Rashid!
What's wrong with you? You're scaring me, tell me what's wrong?
Divorce me, mother, divorce me.
Divorced! How did that happen?
I don't know, Mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know, I don't know.
He divorced you without a reason!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know. He suddenly came and told me, "Go to your family's house."
I asked him why he did that. He said, "You're divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's going on?
They were only married for one month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I only know that he divorced her, from you now.
Sit. I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
I criticized Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she insulted Barcelona, and he is very attached to this team and respects it.
Insulted him and hurt his feelings.
My mother told me she insulted Barcelona, and I said to him, "Divorce her and I'll get you a second wife."
I tell him that your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
Come on, that's why he divorced her, are you serious?
What matters to me.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife questions her husband's loyalty.
How true what I hear!
We don't need a daughter who doesn't respect international differences.
This time, you started laughing at Messi.
Problems between a couple occur and we must deal with them.
One dress, a thousand girls.
The girls are many and wish to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And please don't interfere. This is my son and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
I'll be upset with you.
Don't trouble yourself, my son, and don't think about it.
One dress, a thousand girls.
Why are you upset!
But when I remember her words
That Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Okay, my love.
What's wrong with it!
Her name is Mona.
Was she married for one month?
If I tell you her story and why she got divorced, you won't stop laughing.
To involve you with him, we need your attention.
What's the use of a person like this, who divorces his wife because of a football team?
The barber knew them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't let me get involved in this, I don't want to get into trouble with this person.
That's all, you're hearing hairdressers' nonsense.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her say her nonsense and say what she wants to say.
Wealth is coming to her.
I told her, "Oh! Girl, don't stop your luck."
If it was just her luck, I wouldn't care at all.
But she will stop her fortune and ours with it.
This building
He never said no to me.
God is sufficient for this bad shave.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Do not listen to her.
Tell her and let her understand not to close the door of luck that will open for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You're supposed to be joking. Can you believe he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all these illusions and don't be crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And it's possible that she is the reason or there is something wrong with her that made him divorce her.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Borgain slip through your fingers.
What is this, the two-towered one?
But when they get closer, they discover they are two towers.
That's why they called his father Shahin Abu Borgin.
God welcomes you.
No, no, no. My love. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
May God grant you a long life (proverb), they took the money before, you signed and they spent the money.
You seemed distracted and very busy, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, and he is divorced.
He was married and divorced as well.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, brother, be firm with him.
Oh man, this generation is tough.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations my daughter.
Oh my daughter, don't forget your brush, I put it on top of the bags.
So you can take it with you when boarding the plane.
Upon your arrival in London
Come on, son, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mother.
Okay, that's fine.
So you can come with us and shop as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Take the fur with you to Malaysia.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's in it?
I don't know.
I'm asking her and I have no idea what's going on.
Tell me, my daughter, what's happening?
You did your part and ignored her the best you could.
She is nothing.
On your honeymoon, you're supposed to be taken care of in every way.
Is it logical that she's sitting while you're pouring the water?
And the glass is beside you, it doesn't carry you but it lets you drink.
Wasn't raised well.
You should have told her from the day she was born that I only drink water from my mother's hand.
What's in it?
She looks very sad.
And who is this lady with her?
Her name is Michelle.
Poor thing, she got divorced from her husband during the honeymoon.
Would you believe me if I told you her story?
God bless you, auntie, thank you.
Your aunt asked, and also your aunts.
Yes, but I don't know where my mom booked us.
Hello, Mother.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
This is really nonsense.
Where is the light?
She's in her room talking to that idiot.
Now she says she's been calling him for two days and his phone is switched off.
She just found it now.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is coming from outside, tired, and he wants to rest.
Mom, every day I tell her to peel the apples, but she doesn't do it. Every day she bothers me.
And you know I don't like the apple with its skin.
She peels the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
And another one when necessary.
Come on, my light!
Come on, my light!
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you still upset!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Shut up, God bless you.
I don't know, mom, about the one who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
Right, he has nothing to say.
She will dance twice or three times.
And I wish the one who divorces my daughter would die.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to vent my anger on this rude man.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Inlaid with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds
And the other girls are your game and your son's.
They have no families and mothers to feel the bad food in their mouths.
Who are you trying to fool?
And set them free as you will.
I helped you drink water, you cursed Barcelona, divorced her, and forgot about her.
The one who went to a nightclub.
Without shame and embarrassment
A ministry agent, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his own reputation and that of his children.
Stay still and don't move.
Be a little human.
It was my father's.
Who sells such land?
Abu Sakr took it from his father by force.
Why is he selling it?
God guide us, if Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone say no to him?
Leave it to God, man.
Please, go ahead.
Come on, come on.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to his office?
I told you, if you want to run your project, you need to start paying for it.
Abu Sakr, this big millionaire
Doesn't he eat? Doesn't anyone in this world not eat?
No problem, brother. We'll make him eat and feel full, and fill his stomach. The problem is how we can reach him.
You must know the key to Abu Saqr, so that it can open all the doors for you.
I meet him in Umrah and greet him more than once.
All you need to know, as long as you're paying him and running your business, all you need to know is the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you at dinner.
I came right away.
Abu Sakr, may God preserve him, has a feast every day.
Oh man, anyone.
He enjoys gathering and hanging out with friends.
It's very nice to stay at this farm overnight.
Yes, Your Honor, this is Abu Nasser Malik, the owner of the car dealership behind the mall.
He wants to meet you, Your Honor.
I got the license.
It's like my son who got the licence.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Saqr.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, say yes.
Just say yes, Your Honor.
As a gift for him
And please, don't say no.
My work is going well.
This means you met him easily and talked to him.
Don't be stupid.
Yes, that's it, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what the technique is, what did you do?
Circumstances served me well.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got his license.
I have a gift, a falcon.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
Come on, take me to him.
Yes, that happened.
Tuna has just been discharged from the hospital.
Tonsillectomy
And certainly he is preparing a feast.
Your son's health is worth it, dear! Pride.
We hope it improves, we hope it improves, God willing, he will not see any harm, God willing.
And we met at the rosary shop.
I think so.
Man, we're starting to forget and get old.
They told me your son Shahin was in the next room and has already left.
I thought I should visit you.
And congratulates you on Shane's health.
Listen, sir, you shouldn't have gone without having dinner with us.
I'm not in the mood for that.
Say yes or no only.
Because our beloved son Shahin has been discharged from the hospital,
In my Corniche Tower
Just say yes.
Oh my son, don't be stubborn.
Mom, don't try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a project without capital these days?
At the vehicle and crane agency, he just said let him point.
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
Whatever God wills, your father is loved by everyone, you just point him out.
My son, people take loans from banks to establish a company or a business project.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
This is something new as well.
This is Saqr, the apple of my eye. He brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples. Try them."
He just took their agency yesterday.
"You se
He also told me that all businessmen are like me; may God make everyone like you.
Yes, Your Honor.
On my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
Really, I love him.
I don't know who owns it.
Congratulations, congratulations, Uncle Sakr, congratulations.
God bless you.
In the name of God, in the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it easily (like that).
You, now you can say no.
What's the problem?
What should I say?
Be his partner.
Do you know who his father is?
Who knows his father!
I said I was a friend of Qasim Abbas, he asked me if I had work experience.
I said I have a bakery, praise be to God that I live off it.
No, no, I don't like the name.
I noticed it.
No, brother, the name is not nice.
This is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Understood, big boss.
Qassim, we call it the big bread bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God, Your Excellency.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayd, she's a new employee here!
Ma'am, I just sent her car for maintenance, and she came to take mine because she's an advertising agent in a marketing company and she can't do anything without her car.
You might still need your car later.
No, I don't need the car today.
Okay, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent! Oh, Dr. Sami!
Yes, Your Honor.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study either commerce or economics.
He never read a book all his life, not even a newspaper. I never saw a piece of paper in his hand all his life.
You all know who Falcon is today.
What I wanted him to do was to enter the field of business and %pw, but
Uncle Abu Nasser, he is still alive and here before you.
What he loves.
But there are people who are born for work and naturally love work.
You're right, oh! Doctor
God willing, Shahin, that you will be like your brother.
God is generous (proverb), God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on education.
No one can be like you, oh! Dr.
Frankly
How did Falcon, who hates trade, easily attain such great economic sense?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they will count them among them.
Do you know Oh! Abu Saqr?
He chose a squirrel for the knight's rank in the market.
Peace be upon you
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Falcon, son of Falcon Sr., wants to take over my father's car dealership?
The agency no longer owns it.
People are never satisfied.
Dad helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to trade.
Frankly, the doctor said he was in critical condition.
This isn't going to work.
Nothing works.
Shocked or not, not my problem, I'm telling you to divorce her, divorce her and you will divorce her.
There are such people in the 21st century.
We meet with our dear viewers with one of the kind and giving men in this country.
A man who knows the way to the needy and deprived.
So we are the founder and owner of the Sakr Association.
Of course, if we speak about this organization, Sir,
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to convey to the world, and of course, to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, we were recently able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, we are ready for delivery.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
Whatever God wills, my beloved. May God increase people like you.
My wife and I just left home.
But my wife will spend half an hour to launch her new project.
I'm waiting for her.
No problem.
I really love their atmosphere and enjoy sitting with them; I really have a great time.
And also a source of income for my children.
He is my whole life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
All bread is hot, hot bread.
Come on, people!
There are such people in the 21st century.
There are such people in the 21st century.
If anyone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
Needs brave men.
Long live Souq Waqif.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you all.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love is from God.
Dad, I have something to say, but please just say yes.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin has to go to the exhibition and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The wind blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh breeze, for love, take me home.
Hello, Fadi.
How are you, Anood?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you sent me a message saying it would be ready in ten days, oh! You idiot.
And you want your crystal dress, which takes more time.
And if God wills, you will start talking to Al-Anoud and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be sad, but I'm not sad.
What more do you want, Fadi? They've started envying you.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them unlike our people.
Don't forget the subject.
Is my dress ready?
Go ahead, Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi, I'll pass by next week to get the dress, okay, bye.
How can I help you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
God willing, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he's doing exceptional work and girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we were very successful in this project.
What's the matter?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong?
Look at the jealousy!
And we have not heard that he started a project, where does this bankruptcy get the money from.
Open your mouths, plunder!
And when he starts his business,
Are you sure?
I heard some whispers.
And if God wills, what will you do?
7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already eaten breakfast.
But, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you...
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these things, God guide you, Uncle.
Design, women's fashion design, something like that?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, just, I
You need advice, you need %pw I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Cousin thank you.
So can you forgive me, I have to go.
Go ahead, Chief!
The first time you tell me if you need more.
Fadi, clean the shop, I notice you're busy?
The shop is no longer sufficient.
You said you would rent the shop next door, so rely on God and take it.
I wish.
Did they rent the shop next door?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Saifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, right?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction at my friend's place. His name is Islam, and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the ring and read his name on it.
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong.
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong, there's a fault in it.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
I said I had to destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a sheep herder? What does he say?
I was testing you; I asked you if you intended to start a project.
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your demands.
But that's not what gets you there.
Man, it's a living. Everyone's gotta make a buck.
You defeated me.
Come on, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh crossed the border.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
A Lebanese designer arrived.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Madam, this suits you wonderfully, no, no, no, this, this is unparalleled in all of Doha.
Oh, this suits you, madam. And these beautiful words and the piece worth a thousand, they sell it for thirty and forty thousand.
Yeah, just do like him.
As you know, the cabinet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unprecedented in all of Doha.
See, if you want to be successful
What exactly is the problem with it?
Why don't you know?
This means he had stolen from the clients.
What do you think about moving to another place, boss?
Don't mention it, don't mention it, Fadi.
By this time, they will be playing by themselves.
It means we lost, no!
We have to confront them!
And our customers always come back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'm paying.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
This dress I chose is worth sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without the tie in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, mine.
And I put on it a crystal, there are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there is no discount, our prices are known worldwide.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's happening? What's going on?
They have wronged us, O Sa'd, they have wronged us.
Is this something they do?
They killed us; we don't have any clients left.
This is called war, Abu Nasser.
We don't stop and watch!
We need to fight them the way they fight us, and also respond to them.
Tomorrow I'll take a loan from the bank.
And I'll start a war against them and see what they do.
Abu Nasser won't stop him.
Check the ad!
Look at the ad he's posting!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
He made four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We're running a quarter-page ad.
See, he published a half-page ad.
I have no idea what he was planning to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
For six days, not a single customer entered their store.
No, and they didn't open this afternoon, they closed.
And you'll hear that he's put it up for sale.
I'm going to kill him, I'm going to kill him.
Even they can't sit there, he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and let it go.
What kind of tea can God give you? I can't drink it, that's the problem.
Is there anyone who bears a grudge against you?
There's one, God bless you, who intentionally sprayed the place with this perfume.
And these are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You're cousins, you're adults, not children, so don't fight like kids.
He came at night and sprayed a bad smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything, that's your scent.
Do not cross the line.
You signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I prepared a hellish plane for him.
Without anyone finding me wrong
No, everything is fine.
This is what baffles me.
I swear I don't know what's going on, this is the fourth day and not a single customer has come in.
Oh no, this isn't the right place, we have to go to the other store, I've shown my face, God guide you.
What did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and there are no customers entering the store.
I don't know if they did magic to him.
Women and girls are not allowed near the shop.
As if magic had turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Go and see him, brother, go, I'm afraid the roof will collapse.
It's lost, Sultan, it's lost.
I don't know, turn him into a dog!
Leave him alone!
Calm down, brother. Don't be angry.
I don't know what he did.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? They say his friends have started collecting money and paying off his debts.
Designed
I'm not Lebanese.
Did you tell him, did you tell him?
Do you know where he is?
The stars are the same and we desperately search for those additions.
Call the men again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong, what's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed?
What's wrong with you, Ahmed? You're just sitting here while the manager is shouting at me! What should I do? Where's the raise you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone, I called him and he gave me a headache, I'll even ask Mr. Abdullah.
First, don't scream. We're actors and we need to rest a bit. We need to focus on our roles. Second, the man called more than once in front of me, but calm down.
What are you saying, Mr. Abdullah? What are you saying?
Oh! Oh, Mr. Abdullah, what should I do now? The director is about to finish the scene and he's going to shout at me.
Alright, guys, alright, guys.
We just want to finish, but these extras who are supposed to be in the scene aren't here yet.
You don't want anyone to shout at you, do you?
Work quietly and without shouting.
This is always our state: screaming from morning till night. We need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about managing yourself in a scene? I'll get you an actor who does a good job with the role, God willing.
True, he'll act in one scene.
But this scene is the most important in the series.
But please, sir, go and shoot now, please.
But if you're not ready today, I'll resign.
Guys, let's go upstairs.
"I'm telling you something, in Filipino, is that acceptable?"
You don't know Abu Walid, he'll stand up right away. He needs someone who's like elite, has to be elite and Qatari.
Dude, he's going to wear the gutra and agal, and no one will notice.
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easy way out. That's the problem, respect people's feelings and intelligence.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and now you can be at ease.
Calm down, so we can think. Reem, think with me, maybe you'll remember someone from your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember someone in Al-Sulatta neighborhood named Saud Bakhtoon?
The same Saudi snuff.
%PW Say Saudi cans!
The director said he needs a wealthy man of stature, and you say cans.
Dear, by the end of the day it's extra, you will bring a rich and distinguished man to an extra role.
But with a little makeup, Reem, in her abaya and clean dress, and a luxurious car.
We hope it's suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you
Happy scanning?
So who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, he is, he is.
Yes, it's him, thank you very much.
Now how am I supposed to work, Mother? There's no other option besides this trio that Uncle brought from outside.
Your son, you only have one to wear.
Oh my son, it's inside the closet under my clothes.
Mom, people are waiting outside, what should I iron?
God help you, boy!
This means that today I'll see you on TV.
Yes, Mother, and they said I'd be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, you cheapskate!
Come on, man. What's this? Dust on you.
Spray, spray.
Here it is, Mother.
Quickly, Mother, are you feeling better?
God willing, my son.
God willing, they'll give you some money.
God helps you.
Pray for me.
I bring you Saudi cans, Saudi laptops.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Abboud, the son of Fatima, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Will it ruin the scene?
Yes, yes, God willing, God willing he'll do well, calm down and stay relaxed, so they'll give you a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is.
She's not the same person who used to collect the rent like before.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You are wearing glasses now.
You're a grown man now.
You don't change, and I'll regret nominating you.
The men who brought them to Abu Abdulaziz's house.
He is here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Javil Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I only fear God.
Don't worry, stay calm and listen to his instructions. Say yes to anything the director tells you.
Brother, brother, please, you're playing the role of one of the elite, one of the rich, do you understand?
Come here, boy, come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is not a very serious person, the role needs someone who is aware.
Everything is acceptable from certain people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
Brother, we bought this for the shoot. Listen, I'll take you to the makeup room now and rehearse your role with you.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, please.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God that you're here, come in, come in.
Boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud, he cleans everything, he fixes it.
Let's do it again, and the assistant manager is here to see you and assure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a well-known and respected merchant.
Are you saying this?
Yes, yes, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush, I didn't expect that from you. Oh! (Abu Abdulaziz), say you're Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights
Beautiful, and you should know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother.
He will clean and complete the full name, Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzook, my darling.
Beautiful, go ahead, go ahead and think.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Don't bother asking why I divorced her.
Your daughter is divorced, is she beautiful? Is she beautiful?
She is very beautiful, go ahead and consider yourself, we are not getting married.
Why don't I tell him?
Great, you're amazing and he remembers everything, amazing.
Let him clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Man, the house owners surprised us and needed the hall, so the director decided to finish the indoor scenes in the hall and then shoot the outdoor scenes.
How is that? They don't want the password!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed for later. They will shoot another scene, and we'll be right behind them, God willing.
Shall I tell them to get you some tea?
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Hello, which tribe do you belong to, boy!
My name, Your Honor, is Salem Abu Shawi Al-Shawi.
The Shawys are famous.
You deserve it.
"It teases, my nose is big and even the lips can be outlined here."
Tell me, brother, people have a high nose nowadays.
I support myself.
If it were someone else, they wouldn't stop laughing.
Hold this for a minute.
Hello, Mother.
My mother is very sick, I need to go quickly, brother!
You will wear these clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she's very tired, he says!
Listen, you can go like this, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we can't leave the place.
Okay, okay, I'll try to hail a taxi. Oh, brother!
Which taxi? If you try to look for a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
You know we're renting the car for the scene.
Since it's stopped, take it.
Oh! Brother, please give me the key. Mom is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
He's in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Wait, wait, I'll get the wheelchair now, now oh! Old man.
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
Mom is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? In the car?
Oh my son, oh my son, what happened?
Be quiet and don't talk, just watch and keep silent.
Peace be upon you
There's nothing wrong, but your mother, my lady, has asthma, quickly.
I'll tell them to make the bed.
Okay, okay.
Don't bother.
God is sufficient for you. What have you done?
All right, Rashid!
Take care of our son Rashid.
Suit yourself, come with me, Professor Rashood.
Come with me, Mr. Rashood.
And I'll take Mr. Rashood and do what's necessary for him.
This is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and see what Your Highness would like to drink.
Come with me, Professor Rashood.
Excuse me.
What should I do, there are a lot of people, but wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink: tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first, Nasser, the hospital security guard, to marry a Filipino.
Who told you I was rejected?
Not even one woman gives me attention.
They philosophize and demand.
He doesn't have a certificate. I don't want your mother. What's this? I don't want your mother! Go and look for your friends.
Oh brother, there's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, look for someone else.
Oh, my brother, my heart is broken!
Your brother has fallen in love, believe it, when I see her.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
May God curse you.
Your happiness, our aunt is now enjoying full health.
You are a professional actor Oh! Saud, oh! Guys, next!
Bravo, see how they applaud you and praise you.
Now, go change your clothes and get rid of your makeup.
Come on, man, forget about it. Come and take a breath here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzooq.
Forget about this and write Saud.
Saud has passed away.
From now on, my name is Fahad Al-Mrazouq, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, my dear.
Buffet one!
I made two.
Even I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are so classy, and I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love, goodbye.
Look at this, Mama.
I need to get them something for the occasion of my wedding contract signing.
What's wrong, Mom?
Look at your brother who's ruining our reputation!
Yeah, this is embarrassing, by the way, it's cheap.
But this depends on our budget, it works.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
It's good that I saw her.
This type is the free class, it is for the highest aristocracy.
Approximately above average.
No, we want something unusual, something no one can afford.
I'm sorry, my lady, you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities (like me).
Shut up, just shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay using a credit card.
What is this luxury? It's very advanced.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I am at your service, I am at your service.
He will come to you.
They booked the small hall and the food was terrible.
Very cheap.
"She who said it about a happy marriage."
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
My dear sister,
He's just worried about the money.
He doesn't care about what people say.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
But we're supposed to answer something based on our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people take loans, sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and prevent people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, the cheap chocolate is enough to embarrass us.
I said the director liked the dish and took it home.
Okay, if the bride's family says that we choose the hall, the stage, and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we choose anything!
No, not really, but the store we just went to had a very good price.
By the way, this shop designed Abu Dhahb's wedding ceremony.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, once.
At Azza's daughter's wedding, congratulations.
No, no, no, we don't need anything that's been used.
I need a platform that we will be the first in the world to use.
This means you want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very new and up-to-date.
How much does this stage cost with the other arrangements?
I'll calculate it for you now, but it's not going to be less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Hmm, at this rate, our money won't be enough. Everything is so luxurious, the best and the finest. All of this costs money.
Everyone does this.
Please be quiet.
What's the decision?
Did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, I don't need Noah's Ark.
This is the wedding and its costs. By the way, we are considered middle class.
Do I have to pay 150,000 for a theater and 150,000 for a dance hall, the one you booked as the Royal Hall, as you call it?
I didn't say box, but why the show-off and everyone wanting to see the other and everyone wanting to outdo the previous one.
It's a battle of egos, and only wedding shop owners benefit.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, they exploit us and lie to us.
I swear, I have a friend who says his brother has a wedding hall.
He says the stage won't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for the moment when his father says yes.
Alright, do something.
Like the rest of the young people who get married and can manage on their own.
Hello Sheikh, my honor.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's why I'm calling you.
The first time I was in Qatar, designed by international artist Peter Salamoun.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the Solar System.
With the Noah's Ark stage, it will look amazing.
In this harmony, you are the first one in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Okay then,
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Okay then,
God comforts you.
As you like it.
Many expenses, my brother.
By the way, I couldn't get all eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Fahd.
How can I sort things out? Oh! Fahd, as long as we boast at weddings, we are in trouble.
Without any review
Of course, you'll receive the invitations you want.
Yes, this week, God willing, we'll start sending out the invitations.
Our marriage will be better than theirs.
Mom, look at the invitations my son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, print it, and come back. And also Manar's family.
They went to France; even people who are not rich go to Lebanon to get their visas.
The system works like this in the country, do you want to be different?
Fleesh, which country do you want to travel to?
We saw some amazing invitations.
Indeed, it's expensive, but...
But it's unique, and no one has ever done it before.
Shine, I love it.
Gold will be much better, shiny.
Brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
Why did he get busy with himself later?
Stop the acting and boasting at weddings and all these useless expenses.
The only beneficiaries of our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
That's it, he's leaving, poor him.
Let me get it, he might not find anyone to take it.
Alright, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, Abu Nasser!
Brother, the bride's family has to support you.
I tried once, but just once.
I said there that there was no need for a ballroom in a very well-known hotel.
Why, I found our daughter on the street, and others like her are no better.
This is the problem, everyone is looking at the other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that pride.
It's all about a simple party and some small expenses.
Come on, man, these days people get married on Facebook.
Cheaper and less costly.
This means you won't marry from your country.
Forget about it, do you want me to go crazy?
You'll see.
If I don't invite Abdullah or Nawal to my son's wedding.
Damn her, she won't be better than me.
Father, I want to ask you something, dear.
If your son has a social security number, please provide it to us so we can contact him.
Okay, dear, thank you very much, goodbye.
Oh mother, we agreed on the DJ, why did you change your mind?
And will Umm Nasser be better than me?
I forgot who she was and who we were?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That's not it, Mom. Just look at my brother Saleh, he breaks my heart and we don't pressure him too much.
Indeed, you broke my heart.
Really!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, it just happened suddenly.
I heard that and fell for it right away.
He has no flaws and no one can blame her. After she prepared everything and people knew, he simply said he didn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He's embarrassing us, he wants to cancel the wedding.
God willing, everything will be alright.
Don't break her heart.
My son, you are a man and you are the provider.
Go, check on her and reassure her.
I swear, if you told Abu Youssef that, his heart would stop beating.
Do you know why the minister kept Abu Youssef until now?
By the way, he was supposed to retire three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong, he's helping me.
I swear you're crazy.
Did you understand what I want from him now?
And let him hide the papers and statements until you return the money.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't talk, and I don't know why, why you're terrified.
There's nothing to worry about, and in the end, I'll return the amount to you.
Do you know what they call me, do you know what they call me?
The committed, the committed.
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there's no other way.
If I give you and later the scrutiny people
They are strict in their scrutiny, they catch me quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
You ate, you ate the pill.
No, no, God willing, we'll be in the hall from 7:30 to receive guests.
No, no, we will definitely be there.
I'm going to throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise!
Okay, dear Fatima, I'll get in touch with you later.
I'm worried about you. They envy you, my son, if you go to them with such a bag tomorrow.
Mouth, is the length of the coat good?
The police are here!
We hope that there is nothing wrong.
"The %Pw police, but stay here and I'll be back."
May God protect you, Salah.
Forget your wedding.
The marriage cage, now we're entering the prison cage.
They discovered the document I was hiding for your loan, and now suddenly, they discovered me.
Why are you upset!
You're going to hear about much worse disasters than this.
What should I say next!
A respectful and dedicated employee
The one who loves his job, the ministry contracted a company for maintenance.
The employee, anxious about his job, went to inquire about the materials.
He found out it costs four hundred thousand.
It will save the ministry one million six hundred thousand.
And the minister punished him! No, no, no, I can't believe it.
Why can't you believe her!
Here is Saad.
Of course he has all the news.
He was fired from his job.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
He told him, "Let her work instead of Osman."
Who is she?
She is the daughter of the director of the same company that presented the maintenance offer.
Uthman was discovered.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always surprised, Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
We've become like this!
What are you saying!
I'm not talking about what I say, this poor employee Osman, what's his fault!
His mistake is that he is sincere and loyal!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he just left.
What's up in the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do about it.
That's not reasonable, Your Honor. He has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
He lived off this job! What's he going to do now and where's he going to go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee whom the minister hired.
I entered Uthman's office and started working. The poor Uthman came to take his belongings, I prevented him and told him to go, I will send you your belongings with the bay's tea.
Where is he now?
Things have changed, Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is God's will (proverb).
Praise be to Allah the Great.
Great God, O Generous One! O Uthman, God will not forsake you, farewell.
What's the problem? You don't look good!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
What a job! I simply can't work, I'm leaving now.
It's an opportunity for me to visit my mother and get you the things.
I don't want you to stay upset like this.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not yelling at you, I'm asking you.
How is this acceptable, and what right do you have to go with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed. Where have you been living?
I don't know, Mother!
You're crazy.
People have been liberated, the world has become a small village, where are you living!
But what can I say!
Be modern, live this time and don't look back.
Get the stuff out of the car quickly! Come on, don't look at me and lock it.
Something's wrong, Saleh. What's the matter?
No, you're not okay today.
I shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I'm not hungry.
So I can forget the disasters I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The manager is a bit angry.
That pleases us, Your Excellency.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Hard work and perseverance.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Alright, peace! Your Honor.
Tell me, what's the use of an employee who doesn't take bribes?
He is useless.
That's why I want you all.
There is no place for loyal people and those with crumbling principles and values.
If you ever discover
He'll only blame himself.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nourah doesn't take a bribe one day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I don't just want it to be like this, I want all of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to pick, you've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough, ya! Umm Saud, enough, don't torture me more.
I don't want to live in a prison.
But God is sufficient against Satan, for he has tempted me and made truth beautiful to me.
He told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why bother with honesty and loyalty?
All your life, you've been a thief and comfortable.
It's good that I didn't become a saint.
Let me talk to your father.
Never do it again.
He must be on the straight path, bribing, stealing, and showing hypocrisy to live in peace.
Dad is in jail because all his money is illegal.
Stop, stop.
Is this something to wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why isn't it uncovered?
You don't feel shame, you're shameless.
I'm shy, I wear my brother's clothes.
Are there shy girls nowadays?
Why are you shouting?
Look at your daughter's clothes!
Would a respectable lady wear something like this?
And you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I'm tired of her; she doesn't listen to what I say.
I never wanted to hang out with you here.
She bought her some see-through clothes she didn't need.
I warn you, if I ever see you below the knee,
Since you are aware of the situation, never blame me for the results.
We are here, God bless you.
We hope he'll be a player, a troublemaker, and a bit of a bad boy.
He is like his father.
As you can see in front of you.
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm bad.
You're a good man. To be honest, I love my daughter Sarah very much and I care about her future.
Only after we heard about it.
Praise be to God, she has a very bad reputation.
I returned home at 3:30 a.m.
And I returned home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and pick me up from the bar.
Start your car's engine and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father not obey his son.
Stop it, dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, basically, my father, Papa is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
Let me introduce you to my friend, Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-boyfriend.
Welcome, come in, it's an excellent opportunity.
Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians didn't cut their nails.
According to the commitment of the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement.
In any case, the United Nations is gathering today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinian fingers.
To see if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing should cut, tear, or draw blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
Made of cork.
And olives, man.
We press olives like this, we press olives like this.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community
To set up inspection committees for Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't go that far, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Salih, Salih, what's wrong?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of an upside-down world.
Oh Rashid, you need to have a strong personality.
Now, brother, what's the number of the school you're working at tomorrow?
I am a teacher like you.
Why didn't I change my school since I started studying?
What a character, brother!
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who were with him were the ones who complained about him.
To that extent, brother!
That's why you see him calm.
Then he started teaching.
What was ketchup, was mayonnaise by %Pw.
Oh brother, we're not talking to you to make you upset.
We're telling you because this is your last chance.
He told me that I accepted Rashid, even though his personality is weak.
Hesitant and very good.
Whatever the case, he is still a citizen.
Why are you this quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow
A new rational man
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Alright, forget it.
And from tomorrow,
Yes, this is good. What's next?
Here I tell you,
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
Let's say a boy jumped and told you what the other boy said at your previous school, and the official was present there.
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, the door breaks.
Well, man learns from his mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I tell you,
I'm nervous.
It's up to me!
Just shut up!
It seems he said, "Just shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Tell him Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems he said what doesn't concern me, but he sees, I don't want to see your face here in class.
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Whose son is he?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Did you see him?
Teacher, the problem is if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him? = Sitting, sitting during the break?
You might find him in the seating area, sitting down.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
By the end of the day, man.
But you shouted in my face!
Friends joking, you're joking with me.
Dad is outside and will return next week, and if he returns, I'll tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdul Rahman, may God protect you.
We are friends. By the way, the raspberry ice cream is very delicious, you should try it. It has a slight bitterness, but it's amazing.
Alright, go and get it quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is him telling his father.
I said his father is abroad.
Yeah, he's out. Doesn't his father come back? That means they took his father's things and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
He carried his bag and brought it to him, you gave him your mobile number, and told him, "If you need anything, call me, I'm your friend."
Yeah, just.
Ah, but what?
You're the one who told me.
Scream and pretend you're strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Hey! Rashid!
Sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't tire yourself, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go quickly.
Put them on the table.
That all people are equal.
That's why I gathered you, to hear your opinions about the party.
How can anyone guarantee a boy?
This is going to cause us a problem; he, he, he is calling.
At three o'clock.
That is, hello. He hung up, and God was joking.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you
He stood with the inspector, sat down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Professor, come here, please come here, Professor.
Are you done screaming?
I'm not laughing at you! Man, I'm just asking you a question, got it?
Have I finished or not? Where is the teacher's status? By doing this, you are insulting yourself and the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, sweet, sweet.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first you need to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Spread out, spread out, we have plenty of space. Come on, come on, come on.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
God helps him.
I'm the boss here.
It is known that Abu Nasser
It was used to give all teachers extra classes.
Except me.
Who's the boss here?
You're the manager, God bless you, what's wrong?
Put your foot down.
You're mistaken; it's on the chair, brother.
What do you mean?
There's no need, I really mean it, I want to ease your burden.
What do they call it?
What should I tell you now?
Act better for yourself, and you will take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you? Get out, get out, get out!
Present, I'll go out.
Do as you please, we told you, man.
We need to keep him in check.
Wait, oh! People, wait.
Don't blame us, Abu Sleem.
Oh Abu Naif, you're the neighborhood leader and you need to stop him from crossing the line.
I'm not my father's son.
You'll see what I'll do to him.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Highness.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
Believe it or not, I didn't recognize him until he spoke. I knew his voice.
Did you know he was promoted last week?
It means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Ask him, he'll tell you, what is the secret that made him rise from the bottom!
Here I tell you from day one,
When I'm studying, I don't want to hear any noise.
"And what is in the soul"
Act yourself.
And you, too, answer me, and argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you become a minister, look for a good job along with it.
So don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the second job, no brother, give me options, different jobs, and I'll choose the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I swear I'm not feeling good after the call I received.
Everyone is congratulating me.
What are they saying, oh Mother? May God guide you.
This is very common. Every minister hires his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, it was a pleasure to meet you.
They know I'll become a minister.
I understand, I understand, they're spraying me, it's a kind of bribery.
Wealth will come to us, a treasure, a treasure that will open to us.
The big earth
Come on, let's go congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations, Your Excellency.
"With your blessings, congratulations."
Congratulations, Ambassador. You deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency the Minister.
O my brothers, the responsibility is great. May God help us with it.
As they say, you are highly qualified for this job (example).
You left, then Abu Saleh's phone rang.
It was far from him.
Forget about it.
I'm amazed to see how he loves him now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, you've accomplished a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband's death here, she said that I was jealous of him.
God willing, God willing.
Ah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mom, let's go, the cup is full (proverb).
What do you mean by "none of your business"?
Just relax.
I cut them because they made me angry.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't want to say it in front of my mom, you know my mom, she'll tell everyone.
She says anything she hears, they call her the strainer, we don't want a scandal.
What guarantees do you have that if he falls from power, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What guarantees do you have that they will differentiate it?
No, I'm very sure about this.
No problem, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of me.
You're going to do magic for him.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
He's a burn-it-and-forget-it kind of guy.
He let him participate in every event that took place in the country.
At that time, he will be burned. When he is burned, he will leave the office. When he leaves the office, he will be fired.
I swear to God, brother, I don't know how and I don't know what to tell you!
Your visit is called, is called a participation that reflects the extent of your love for your country.
Do you believe that?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, sorry sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Come on, for your honor, this is a simple sheep, not your place. What do you think, my honorable, will you come with me today?
The men are waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am sick of awe, I am sick of it.
You are the minister today, he is right. As he said, you are sociable, market yourself with a good reputation!
God sends you these good men.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Take, take.
Today he took him to a poetry night and to a wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'll also tell him about something very nice I'd like to give him.
Listen, I've also arranged a very great educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it glitters. I'm looking for that glitter.
Seller, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, picture O Your Highness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take a picture of me, I'm far away, take it.
This is the bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, His Highness greets you.
A picture, a picture as such. You are flesh, your honor is flesh.
No problem, God bless you.
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know that.
It's a national participation.
Say what God wills.
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid calls you the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a hurtful word.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to last night.
Children's swim meet victory party.
One used to tell his friend,
They thought I hadn't heard them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my nephew.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, every day in the newspaper.
Correct, correct,
I turned on the light when I came to this shop, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, it's no problem.
This means you won't be wandering around and spending time with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't come to pick anything up. I'm waiting for him.
He sat me in the front row and then went to the car to relax.
We don't need anything from him, God guide you.
Please, madam, God bless you, ask your parents. I'll talk to you later just to confirm.
And you're calling yourself.
People are making discounts for us.
I told you.
This job is great.
But let this boy come and get me!
The minister annoyed me, may God harm him.
Hello, hello Minister.
No, I'm just a bit tired today.
Well, if you're more excited than us, we're at your service.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and accompany you, and I hope he can find a party or something similar for you.
Then, a party?
No, no, today we don't have any activities.
No, we don't have it.
Okay, where can we find it?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there anyone I can ask?
Go, God help you.
Sleep and rest
Just a moment, Saad.
Is there anything even until the night of Hina?
Yes, this is good.
There might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the booth and find a photographer to take pictures of his face.
Okay, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, some street league match. Let him stay alone on the field!
What is this! This minister is a joke on us!
Beautiful, this means he reached the top.
His end is very near when he becomes the talk of the town.
Your happiness, he has become much more popular than you.
Your happiness is when you go to a place and take Abu Saleh with you.
O Judge,
A star twinkles.
We'll turn it off and return it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear, if any of you take a picture of me, I'll break his face. I won't allow it.
Brock smashes their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is my brother Khalid.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why like this?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see him!
It's the first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God
Is this eternal?
I haven't seen you in a long time, come to me, my dear.
What are you doing? He's very attached to her.
There is no power or might except with Allah; you always go back to the same issue.
Get out, get out, and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest and don't make a big deal out of it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my father, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
This means that he was playing, playing.
Yeah, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud; I know what to do with him.
How lucky Khalid is! I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the nonsense he creates about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, dear, we're not going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Falcons from Kuwait
Hello, Hamada!
Listen to what I'm telling you.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Let dear Amal choose for herself.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say the one overlooking the sea is better.
So in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we can go from our house directly to the sea.
We and our children
Please, you need to set a wedding date.
No problem, just a year and a bit more.
What's wrong with your brother? He's using too much perfume.
Amal, frankly, noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free to act as they please.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know there's a unisex perfume.
Tell your fiancé to keep his opinion to himself!
What matters to me.
How truthful Khalid is!
It's not the perfume you're using that smells like women's perfumes.
So you can use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Really, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Nowadays, perfumes are unisex.
Here I warn you.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard about the topic from my friends on the council; they say it's very prevalent in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You have to see it, and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances very well and does moves, do you know who she is? She's Khadija Mohammed's cousin.
One for my dear auntie, Kholoud.
Alright, you'll see what I do with it.
His brother Saad is waiting for him now.
Why? Let him come and you'll see, let Saad come! I'll send it via Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, I was defeated.
Why is my relative sitting so far away?
No problem, is your Bluetooth turned on?
No, I'll just send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
I'm traveling tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself?
What will people say?
They say their son left them and traveled, don't make a scandal for us!
Really.
What your son Khalid did is honor and glory!
A man turned himself into a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people when they say this is the brother of a gay man.
Tell him he travels for treatment, study, work, or even to commit suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
Where are you going?
What matters to me is where I go (proverb).
This is the end.
The second one we don't know where he is, and this one here is packing his bags to travel.
Even we don't know where he went.
What did you expect it to be?
What's wrong with you? I'm answering you to make you feel better, and you're responding with harsh words that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
You don't know anything about it and you were busy.
Dad is busy with his work and left the responsibility to you.
You're right, Mom.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are right.
What he did humiliated us in front of people.
I can't see anyone.
Did you say anything to him?
This is my father's greatest flaw.
We are in Khalid's bad homosexuality case.
I told him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
Only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
You must reach our house by that time, Amal.
Don't be surprised.
Khulud and her companions, they care about the reputation of their families.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Whatever religious values they called for.
They go dancing and celebrating.
In the wicked pool.
Indeed, my son! I am in doubt.
Goodbye, Papa
Take care of yourself, son!
Yes, Daddy, I have a little gift for you, Daddy.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what's going to happen, come with me!
Okay, Mom.
I can't believe my dad is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
It's possible he'll leave.
Where will he go? There's not enough time for him to go anywhere.
Reply to me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Daddy!
No problem, Amal!
If I search, I will fail.
To meet someone who has your morals.
But forgive me.
God helps you.
I see you coming on the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If someone has one riyal, they can take a thousand. Oh, how wonderful it is to my eyes.
Of course I can handle it. God bless America, my dear.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
It is twelve hundred.
God is sufficient for you; every time you speak to a driver, you ask, "How much is your salary?"
My salary is very low.
When he sees me, he starts complaining, "My salary is too low and it's not enough." We agreed on a salary of 700, and I increased it by 100 when he got his license. What more does he want?
I told him, "When you complete a year of work, we'll increase your salary."
He seems greedy and we'll have a hard time dealing with him.
Stop, stop, just be quiet, just be quiet, just be quiet, return it and be done with it.
The word "ease" is easy for you, easy.
By letting him complain, I hate riding with him in the car.
Okay, leave it to me.
Now you've told me the story, I'm the man of the house. Shut up, stop, you too be quiet, I'll handle this.
Come on, I want you out, come on!
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends shouldn't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Boss, this is not my friend, this is my uncle.
He came for five minutes and will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
Keep that in mind!
Don't tell the lady that I need a raise, I need a raise!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
These drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred.
It might be thirteen hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'm 100% sure, shut up, I'm not raising you.
You say I raised you an extra hundred, go work!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
There's no use in it.
There's no use with two hundred.
I'm sorry, Shashi.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers are fleeing.
Because they work abroad for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's not beneficial, but when you work outside, you earn more money.
I'm very scared.
Look at these, they're all drivers.
How much?
One thousand five hundred
But I'm afraid of the police who will take me and send me to jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my abaya and about to go out.
I was calling, but now no one is answering me.
He opened his room and the wardrobe was empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
I will just say, God is sufficient.
Present, I'm coming to you.
I went to the police.
If you report, you have no responsibility.
We'll do everything we can.
While you're still checking around the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yes, he will make money and when he is satisfied, he will surrender himself.
We provide them with answers, spend on them, give them clothes, food, and leadership training.
It's not his right.
The match is starting now, come in, entry is better.
Yes, we were worried.
These are foxes, and foxes are not easily hunted.
Do you know that if more than three don't sign up, it means we haven't won, we need ten or fifteen.
This is clear sarcasm, clear sarcasm. Let's be clear, this is clear sarcasm.
This is his level. If he scores more than three, it's not the Foxes team.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, they should thank God if they score less than three, they should thank God.
Any target, these are the trainees. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone, man.
You've scored a goal now, you're relieved and happy now.
Do you think there are also goals, or does it stop here?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes and comes back, and no one can catch it, you'll go crazy. This fox eats chickens.
No, no, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
He said that this fox is a big problem.
You can't hold it.
Yes, oh! Sir.
Do you know or not?
He is a fan of the Foxes team.
He sometimes appears on the show "Refresh Yourself."
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear I'll hit you. The Foxes team never loses, they are always the winners.
Fox, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
Finished, the foxes are the winners.
The birds came to take their livelihood and flew away.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and flew away.
These are foxes, my friend.
This fox took the chicken and ate it.
I didn't see what Sharaf was doing on the field.
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
Clear in the arena and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He spends time with the Qatari elite who go to malls and places like that.
He treated me to a cappuccino.
What a strange world, man.
The boy gave me five hundred riyals in front of me and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
Don't feel ashamed that my team beat yours by four.
Speak boldly, speak boldly about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was expelled
The reason behind that is a rule.
A player was expelled from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmak.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month we meet to choose the best fan.
Great, who did you choose to honor this month?
The board members of the club will decide.
They are not children, and each of you is as big as a camel.
I manage this big club. Student.
Come, come and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is it him?
One speaks very well, the other is silent.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get to him.
The audience has left.
Follow in his footsteps.
He lived here.
He was driving fast.
We're deprived of him now.
Beautiful!
Shut up, you don't decide. I'm the man of the house and I'm the one who decides.
We need to be sure.
Majed Abdulrahman Al-Sabji
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Suba tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I already have a house.
I just want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I help you, people? What do you want?
God bless you.
Come on, folks, would you like some coffee?
"You have nothing to say 'God bless you', you don't need anything 'God rewards you'."
You're saying I'm sure, is that acceptable? We'll be embarrassed in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Mama, mama, I'm mama.
Now, what's your father doing with us? I don't know.
I didn't mean it, Mom!
Please, Mother, don't tell Father.
Your father is turning the house upside down.
Of course, he's going to kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
His mouth, why don't we buy some glue and stick it together?
What are we committed to, son?
How can we find another one like this? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you from him.
Mom, I'm afraid he'll hit me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
Blind, blind, blind! Are you blind!
Are you blind to break the vase, are you blind?
Mom, didn't Waleed come to you?
No, my daughter! He didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home; he's afraid of his father.
This isn't right. Show him some mercy, boy!
This is not upbringing, I hope God guides you, my daughter!
What should I do now, Mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I was worried about the cars on the street.
God protects him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the kids.
Yes, he is kind, good, and beloved, my daughter.
No, no my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from Satan and do not worry, God willing, everything will be alright.
Okay, goodbye my daughter.
Where is Walid?
My father beats me.
Grandma, Dad is beating me to death.
Don't get tense, my dear.
Don't worry, my love.
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son! Come and have some water and rest in my room.
Your face turned yellow.
God guide him, God guide him. Come with me, my son, a little bit.
O Allah, the Generous
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come on, my son, don't worry.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I want.
But the poor buyer was anxious, trembling and agitated by something he hadn't intended to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag accidentally hit the vase, believe me, he didn't mean to do that.
You! You have to support him!
Please don't say anything to him for me. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where is he, where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
He's not here.
He's here! Where?
Enter, come on!
No, no, I'll take it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something other than the old stuff!
Come on, Nasser, my brother, we want to play!
And your mother says you're studying!
Dad, just this one game and then we'll study!
Don't you have a test tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Come on, Dad, go ahead and ruin the game.
Come on, Dad, don't take it seriously. Come on, come on, Dad, we're studying.
What? What are you saying! Listen to me,
If I go now, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
What matters to me.
I'll tell him you don't obey me.
Come on. Everyone take their book and start studying.
Alright, dad, put your phone in your pocket, we're going to study, dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm really confused. I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid if he knows, he'll cause us trouble.
Of course he will ask me, "Why are you taking him to the hospital?"
What's the problem, if I tell him?
If he finds out that Waleed is wetting his bed, he'll kill him.
Oh Mother, it's his fault. Everything is his mistake.
Oh my daughter, it has a psychological impact.
The boy is not a child, he is twelve years old now.
No problem, my daughter.
You're going to come have lunch with us, and I'll give him some advice.
And I dislike his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
Just an argument, my daughter.
Fun and Shopping
She says he pees in his bed every night.
My son pees in his bed every night and you don't tell me the story.
He said I need to take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
He is right.
They need to take him to the hospital, son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
He is looking for a good dry hose.
Beat him until the last person in the neighborhood hears the screams.
Sit down!
Oh my daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly and take a bath, I'll get you some clothes. Go!
Please, if you please.
I have to punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you call that a pass?
And Khalood got forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a pass?
But their grades are good.
He told them that they would be punished if they didn't get fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
They are my children.
Alright, I swear uncle, uncle, this is the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Give him another one.
I tell him, don't go to public places with us.
Yesterday I went to the hospital and they told me not to enter. You are not allowed.
You're different, don't go with us.
Shut up! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop, man, I'm about to die, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm about to die, stop, man.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment, what you'll see at the end of the year if any of you don't get fifty.
I'm draining the pool.
I'll fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman
Wow! Khaled, you did well.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid
Excellent, Faisal!
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and you were second in your class.
The teacher is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The student is afraid of his father because he wants to get a perfect score.
Hey! Hey, son, I'm talking to you!
Call, call your classmate.
He said he saw him by the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandmother's house.
No, he didn't go there.
Where? Where?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
What's wrong, brother?
Ah, of course he failed, he's afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail, but he was an excellent student and ranked second in his class.
Nevertheless, he was terrified to go home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Come here, Waleed.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, you've lost a mark or two, it's fine. I won't say anything, I won't scold or beat you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
and nuclear energy
which account for sixty percent of global oil reserves
Saudi Arabia tops the list with 24% of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States of America, and Nigeria.
Three percent each, and the rest of the world combined at fifteen percent.
Therefore
And also production.
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons behind the haste of the major industrial nations to occupy this region and its countries.
And it is the United States of America that lies upon them, considered the world's largest consumer of oil.
Nevertheless, oil prices are rising steadily.
At the same time as the fall of the US dollar
What is considered a pricing unit for oil?
Where yesterday, the price of one barrel reached
This led to an increase in income in producing countries and at the same time
To increase its inflation rate
Where inflation rates in some of those countries reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world
Prices of commodities and cost of living
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For viewers who want to participate, they can contact us on the program's contact numbers.
Honorable Deputy, hello and welcome.
I would like to start with you at unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where might prices go?
Of course, where prices might go is a perplexing question.
Or what we call market power.
Isn't it OPEC?
And these aren't the productions?
And not the producing countries, OPEC has nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is the only relationship between price that between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't have much to do with it.
What are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel a lot of pressure and have turned to oil and gold, or what is known as "commodities marketing."
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold too.
We've seen gold rise from three hundred and fifty dollars in past years to nine hundred and seventy dollars now.
And as I mentioned earlier, about one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be a slight decline.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is expected to see a drop in prices due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in winter and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
I mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in it.
About Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation comes amid political complexities?
Which were accompanied and today led to most activities of American newspapers and world journalism. It may affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today?
Today, we are in the era of globalization and influence comes swiftly.
Unrealistic factors may influence
And it creates a kind of disruption in the market.
Also creates some types of political rumors
He said there was no plan, but he didn't rule out other options that might apply to Iran.
Markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, nothing is certain now that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And it's possible that we don't know what will happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector
We see these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
In contrast, there are very profitable supplies.
This shows that there is oil being stored.
There is absolutely no shortage in oil supplies.
He may be preparing for the next war.
In light of this reassuring picture you're describing about supply, that there are no obstacles in the supply chain.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will rise to record-high levels.
Oil prices may rise.
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents the importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Today they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, and that's a fact.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it refers to
It means that in the event of any war with Iran, it means there are no guarantees about the extent to which oil prices will rise.
God knows if it can arrive today, we arrived without it.
Wars to one hundred and seven hundred and ten dollars, and it can jump to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under political and psychological tensions.
And the speculators exploited these tensions.
An investor only in oil.
Or what is referred to as real investment, of course, does not include future purchasing or future marketing.
It is called olive leaves.
And it's all speculation in the oil paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
This may lead these people to more purchases and then to more upgrades.
I wish April was April Fools' Day.
I hope there's nothing.
It is said that Cheney is coming to the region, and this is on his main agenda.
Cheney is the owner of this project, as stated by numerous politicians and the media.
I didn't know what was in Cheney's bag.
And I can't predict what will be in it, you know.
Will he ignite the war?
America is in transition.
Why doesn't the boy do something else?
Let's see what happens, if we talk about April, April is coming soon, only a few weeks left and we'll be in April.
And the world can pay.
And America is a big consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
Their production cost is very cheap.
Comparison with West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can
See, we've been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use
Until the end, and do you remember the story of the Caspian Sea War?
Whatever these dreams may be
When you sit with Westerners in a close circle
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked one of the European officials, I said to him: "It's strange that you speak among us in closed rooms."
It's not the same way you talk in front.
Or the media said: It is for political reasons.
And of course, there is something called double standards or two languages.
The language that you know in the Gulf countries.
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And to enter into it.
Despite all this
Commander of the Central Region
Start a war on Iran
Even with an air war or air raid as they say.
In the supplies
You're not late, you're actually very generous.
I disagree with what you're saying.
Even we don't deal with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where the prices are good.
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Set, I mean non-renewable energy.
For (between parentheses) generosity
Arab generosity
Please give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
You are the citizens of the Gulf, OPEC, and the states.
You are very generous to Americans and insist on sticking to their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price for the decline of the U.S. dollar ranges between sixty and seventy.
Okay, now the price is one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar fell by thirty percent.
And now over a hundred dollars.
If we take the ratio and the number
No one denies it.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the U.S. dollar
If we take
This is a comparison.
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it's in our interest at the moment for the dollar to decrease.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy, the United States cannot "do anything."
So what happened to this economic weakness and recession?
You will become even more.
The United States cuts interest rates on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is tied to the dollar.
The first one, more than 100 years.
The first one to start exporting oil barrels; the first barrel was exported from the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars.
And it became from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And for a hundred years, the universe has been interacting and setting prices.
In it, Norway is today considered the third-largest oil-producing country.
Oil export
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Pricing is in dollars, not in other currencies.
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information indicating something different.
You are the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
Do you have secret agreements between you and the Americans?
And the true oil became the covering.
This is true and does not exist.
And these agreements
It stands if oil remains a cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States continuing to cover these systems.
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's talk about OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent honorary members.
Among thirteen countries
Out of eighty-five barrels, forty percent are allocated to OPEC.
There are many giant countries in oil production.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles preventing pricing in another currency?
Search for pricing in another currency.
When the adults decide.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, the shining stars.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
Sixty percent
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a trend and an intention towards change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me speak now, why the European?
Don't export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or roubles
Because it's in their interest, their currency is strong and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where they have a loss.
They produce one and a half barrels for one euro.
No, you're the one losing because your currency has dropped because it's tied to the dollar.
He is also a big loser, a huge loss.
The currency union here in the Gulf has a historical connection.
Do you remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And now you're attached when you talk about separation.
It's like marriage when we get married.
And you want to get divorced, it's not easy.
No, here.
Or you've married the dollar in a Catholic ceremony.
And costs must be examined in a way
It was inspected professionally and reviewed.
And like Kuwait, he dismantled twenty-five percent of his currency's dollar peg.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
He may adjust his currency's rate.
Today is about the topic, but that means you don't intend to study or think about the topic.
The exam, of course, varies as mentioned by the Prime Minister.
He said the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Be in this study.
There's no way you're the only one going along with this.
Kuwait also went alone, why don't you follow its steps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And what else?
That these four Gulf states announce
Everyone believes.
And I mean those who support him personally.
He will support it.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
Made in one or two countries
Until the time of the currency came.
But you're not going to save the situation now.
Of course, there are experts who will conduct this study.
They're the ones who will be.
We're not experts, this requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush, now see what's happening today.
People started... I mean
Of course, in a state of collusion.
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 reached fourteen percent and will reach 15% next year.
Ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the workers' salaries here.
Salaries of Qatar's residents have eroded by between thirty-five and forty percent.
We'll get back to you after the break to find out the size of the salary increases.
Employees in Qatar for at least the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy of Qatar.
And industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, on the significant increase in prices.
in oil that brought millions of dollars to the Gulf and producer states
About oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
The UAE has seventy-nine and eight-tenths billion in reserves and produces two and six-tenths.
Tons and the report in the Kuwait Times is an economic report, Gulf revenues are among the highest revenues.
Saudi Arabia expected revenues for 2008 to be one hundred and nine billion.
And it was
One hundred and seventy years ago, the UAE was six and sixty this year, and it was expected to be fifty-seven.
Kuwait was forty-five and now it is forty-six.
One and twenty percent of oil plus fifty-five billion.
It's a gas, as other reports have said, and God forbid, I mean, we don't envy the happiness of the deputy.
Iraq is forty-four billion.
1.5 trillion
In terms of spending, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries exported one trillion barrels, meaning one billion billions.
The dollar was a type of import.
U.S. investment was three hundred billion.
And nine out of ten billion.
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in Oman, it was 6.5 but will increase to 7. In Qatar, it was 13.75% but will increase to 15%.
This means that those living in Qatar will expect a high cost of living, from goods to prices.
Life is getting harder, prices are rising, and reaching higher rates, especially in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
Then the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
This means you will increase their salaries by 50%.
No, they'll say you're against raising salaries.
This is not true.
In the cabinet, against raising salaries.
There is a problem, and the solution must be the ideal one.
And it's not a quick fix.
Okay, there's a balance between the two.
And there will be... This is it.
The important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Highness' decree on the formation
And he places
And lays a strong foundation.
To solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing now is to control inflation.
Inflation
If you don't control it
But, Mr. Deputy, now
That was specialized in market research and published last February, just a few days ago.
Among them because of the salaries for
Now you're solving inflation and letting inflation eat away at people's income.
Many of them now
Entered other countries
Raise our salaries, then solve inflation, then lower them again.
I repeat what they say, which balances the subject.
But now
And it's not a temporary solution.
Increase it to a greater extent.
So here.
To end inflation
Boredom always
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, correct.
The second point is
And those working in the private sector are not the same as those working in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
We must consider this matter as an additional injustice.
I don't know where you got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Excellency, not in Germany.
I'm telling you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
"The most"
Some of the Qataris who were working in the government office moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
Facing a problem
To move to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
And he gives good salaries.
Attached to what is called market power.
Or market power.
They come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because its salaries are low or its expenses are few.
Or with expenses they come.
We agree on our clear understanding.
I don't predict events and I'm not saying there's a raise in salaries.
No hope after this.
To control inflation
Let's give him some time.
Controlling inflation
And with God's permission, this is what the report said, that Qatar in the year two thousand and eight
Insha'Allah, we say that.
We see that these numbers will change.
Spray some of it on the people.
It's a professional process.
Of course, professionally and everything.
Inflation
Because spending
A lot on different projects.
Allow me to ask some questions from the viewers, and I hope everyone will ask a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what is your question, brother Abdulaziz?
It is based on the ruling families of the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think the justification for that is an OPEC dispute.
Secondly, the total income from oil goes directly to the governor.
Then for the royal family and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the status quo will persist.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Hello, my brother Ahmed.
I won't prolong the conversation, the brother mentioned aspects related to rulers and regimes, and the issue of the linkage between the Qatari riyal and the dollar or other Gulf currencies with the dollar.
America wants to dominate the world and make it submit to its armies.
American trade deficits have become, trade between China and America reached $82 billion.
The European Union provided her with $86 billion.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are bearing the consequences now as Arab countries and Gulf oil-producing states.
It will end in a clash with America.
And among the developed countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, the problem may arise.
Purely military
For the explosion of Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and also American bombs.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question, Muhammad, is...
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, your question is...
But from what I've seen, his happiness is insistent on not replying.
The topic is about not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is declining.
With God's permission, you will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
What is supposed to follow the style of the Arab Brothers?
Thank you, my brother Mohammed, thank you. Now we request the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is:
Good evening to you as well.
Thank you and thank you for the great interview.
What's required is a salary increase, God willing, things will improve.
It's true that we all face problems, not just in salaries.
Salaries, God willing, will be paid.
Alright, tell me your question quickly.
Your line will be cut off, do you have a question?
It's all due to the rise in prices. The increase has affected all goods, and they are all for export.
I am from European countries.
In the Arab world, we have factories and laboratories.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you. You've taken time out of your schedule.
Now the issue of rising prices is considered an important issue.
Supporting the poor, the man told you, "Hold on to the poor, Your Highness."
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here we are for some brothers.
I know Qatar.
For the State of Qatar, this is not true.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and are they?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this wealth go and what do you do with it?
What's inside the response box.
When a Moroccan speaks, they speak in an unreal and unrealistic way.
The person who doesn't see with his eye is...
If he comes and sees Qatar and the huge amount of developments taking place there.
As you grow, grow big, you are right, you are asking.
And every person has the right.
And you have a small population, so where will you bring people from?
Does that really mean you'll bring the surplus from China, for example?
No, we will not leave, by God's permission.
The country is built on a plan and
The ideal independence of the amount of money coming from oil and gas, everyone knows that oil and gas will one day run out.
that Qatar will become
Is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world
Today as well
The focus is on
And that will have a great impact.
Post-oil and gas
For you are not imitating Dubai.
Every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
There will be a medical city where people come to get treated.
There will be a media city that adapts.
Of course, the world today, today we must build.
Building a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we did not welcome this mutation because it surprised us.
And we were not prepared for it, neither humanly, nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now it changes after thirty years.
And better yet
Today there is a vision.
And vision
And vision
Thank you, Mr. Deputy, and I also thank our audience.
Following us in the hope that we've provided you with
Qatar's foreign policy appears ambiguous to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special ties.
At the same time that Qatar had relations with Israel, and still does
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
And Qatar presented.
Started
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar's bow was not far from the important files.
Like Darfur, Hodeidah in Yemen and even Israeli prisoners
Gilaad Shalit, the hand of Qatari foreign policy, was extended to him in a way that disturbed the largest Arab states.
And what kind of power do you put in this position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or contact us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Welcome, Your Excellency the Ambassador
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the newspaper or magazine of Hijaz.
The agreement made with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which relations were restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
Your introduction was very long and needs a lot of answers without your last question.
What I believe you gave her
Especially regarding the Saudi topic.
What is flour?
The Saudi kingdom is very important to Qatar.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of the island.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified from both sides.
And we agreed to clarify.
In the State of Qatar
Conflict with Saudi Arabia
He was always limited in scope.
From perspectives
Praise be to God, that was due to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years have passed.
The relationships were bright, prestigious, and trustworthy.
I want to clarify the misunderstanding between two parties.
This issue was addressed and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
It's not seasonal, but a strategic relationship.
We hope that it doesn't just continue but evolves.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia will withdraw its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically. If I were, I would have avoided many problems.
I always say what I believe.
Saudi Arabia is therefore not diplomatic but faith.
The island topic falls under the media.
Between the parties and many countries participated in the middle
He thinks that he might take points and gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
At the expense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
For reconciliation within the Gulf house.
I mean compared to what came before.
It is a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement, just an agreement of love and interest.
But otherwise, you can ask the island management.
Have you built strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally based on a close strategy.
Can we say one, two, three, and four?
And there must be unity.
And some differences were settled accordingly.
Between some Arab countries and trying to reconcile their other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain action in a certain case, and another state has a different opinion.
"It is considered my point of vie
Some observers believe that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Criticisms
Were you tired and decided to head in a different direction, and from there you moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
Alright, same idea.
No, no, we're not enjoying this and we don't have anything to do.
To deal with any party in this manner
I mean that the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are over.
Among them and I know that there is a very great understanding.
And you know that we founded
And there will be some kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me write this in two lines.
The skirmishes with Egypt began in the eighteenth issue of Al-Ahram newspaper last April.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, he stated that extensive inquiries had been made.
In Hezbollah's network, a sabotage plot was revealed.
The countries targeting Egypt, three states are involved: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And he is known for his media horn for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect.
And his struggle over the years.
I'm not saying this to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
Egyptian President
And whoever seeks guidance...
On Arab relations
The first point
Gaza Situation
As they say and as we acknowledge.
Qatar is
A state of smaller size
What could be part of these plans?
Because we have suffered from the interventions of other countries at one point, and I don't want to go back to that again.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy.
What I want to say is that God can protect the house, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, I won't defend them.
If stability prevails in Egypt.
And why would Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the pyramids don't come out of thin air.
He said that the small state of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you were seeking to organize a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media outlet, which is Al Jazeera Channel.
Yes, please go ahead.
With Hezbollah
And we're not comfortable with it.
But I can say that we're certain.
If
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
They imposed on our brothers in Egypt, and for this we blame the Egyptian officials.
The conflict with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
I'm coming for this.
Days of the sweet scent of peace, the cause of peace, and us.
She had previously resided in Egypt.
And then after that
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
You don't have a problem with Edraiel.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive.
This sensitivity
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this is an allergy.
Or three
Gaza Conference that took place
Egypt does not want a base in Qatar.
Not Arabic
I am in Qatar and there is a summit in Kuwait. We informed them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
More than two weeks
But we hold it before any organized conference, the Kuwait Conference in which we were the first attendees.
People are being killed and
And with procrastination
The conflict began.
No small nation could afford it.
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also considered a violation against Egypt, not anyone else.
When they said later.
Okay, you're on the island.
And the Israelis were informed a day earlier that there was a meeting to stop the aggression before any speech, any person, or anything.
What is this?
My brother, let the medicine and food enter through the beating our brothers had to endure.
They say the gate was narrow.
I can't get the trucks in.
When will they tell us there's a deal on the other side and they have to come?
Now is not the time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
What matters to me is neither Fatah nor Hamas; what concerns me is the one and a half million and the one million six hundred thousand who are suffering.
And those who don't have medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference
Qatar's involvement in the matter affects the Egyptian regime.
Don't interfere.
We said how Egypt will resolve the situation because it's within its purview.
One of the officials said, "We have uncovered a major plot from this thing."
He still hasn't told us what the conspiracy was.
We mean this officially.
He tells us that Egypt is very important.
Well, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask so much of a big country.
Because Egypt is ours.
And you were invited to a conference where there was also provocation for them.
We were invited to a conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We were in sync and had a unified stance.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know Turkey brought things through Israel.
I will be happy if I see him enter through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does a good political act.
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish your question, it took your introduction a quarter of an hour.
The situation now is that you've lost me.
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now in anger.
Who is responsible for you in the Egyptian system?
We are responsible for the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they are the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom he wanted to share.
And he wanted to reconcile them.
That's why he intervened and did not allow some countries to attend.
I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
I have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or any of the officials
Among the high-ranking officials
A large country where an official discovers a small country doing such things.
That means it was for you.
To take any role
Darfur is part of Egypt's and Sudan's national security.
The five great nations decided.
Any country other than Qatar will be fine.
But these sensitivities will only make the situation worse. Why do you have to interfere in everything around you and bother people?
We want to resolve this allergy, take an antihistamine, they should tell us what this allergy is.
Why allergies?
Some brothers from the government
They want, they have an internal dysfunction.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza Revolution.
It's like what the English say, "blame the Italians."
Whenever something happens
Not just for instructions, also for analytics.
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
And it was not resolved.
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first investigate the reasons that concern my country.
Then I'll check if I have enough time.
And to investigate the causes that concern my Arab nation.
Or Qatar tried to reconcile.
And thinking about any Arab issue where he can contribute as much as possible.
Why is it provocative? Why don't we take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
What emanated from his heart.
Let me finish.
When an initiative for reconciliation was announced and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we hoped for something good and welcomed it.
There are dictations.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, I believe, or a television interview or something like that, I won't respond to him.
Because I have an answer for every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and bind Arab interests
Also, it responds to the invitation mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him and others on is
They are trying to correct their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we have our mistakes in politics and economics, so no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny that there is a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations, undermine its role, and weaken its ties with Turkey and the European Union.
First and foremost, we are a small number.
If we can pull this off
This is not true.
There are some accusations directed at you personally.
To pay money to the detainees held by Shalit so that Qatar can take charge of receiving Shalit and surpass the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always blame us for paying money, first we didn't pay any money and we didn't talk to anyone about giving money.
But this situation
We support Egypt to solve the same thing as we support Egypt and still do to solve the problem between the Palestinians.
He is the one who kept the Palestinian president until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
In power and for Palestinian institutions to remain until the conflict is resolved.
And We said, "He is"
"At the Arab League, but he said no, we made it happen because we believe that some people don't want it."
But we made it happen cleverly.
Is he addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
I really don't know if there's a problem.
I don't know whether it's from us or from them.
They decided now in the twelfth issue in last April exclusively with Al-Shorouk newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter the media outlet known as Al Jazeera, and that's it.
It's a matter of days and everything will be over.
Are you afraid the island will become a thing of the past?
We're living in a political adolescence now.
I also visited Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar sat with the Saudi king.
We didn't concede to them, nor did they concede to us.
We treated them as brothers.
A small country yields to the large country Egypt.
In Saudi Arabia, there's an important point we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we'll talk.
Well, what about the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on him heavily.
Let me be honest with you.
Is it a dispute in core politics?
I hope it's not a personal dispute because we have no personal dispute; I've told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I ask you, you'd say there are two problems: Gaza and what else.
This situation has affected all of us deeply.
We want to solve this problem from a psychological perspective, meaning to resolve this dilemma.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
But it's clear that things got worse and weren't resolved.
No, no, there was listening.
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They reproach us, and it is their right as our brothers.
And we cannot blame them, for they are our younger brothers.
With the big country, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other big country.
I mean that Egypt is big enough for contentment.
It's not a matter of life or death, but the solution comes from heaven.
For us, if someone is waiting for satisfaction.
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You'll be dealing with non-relatives or non-siblings.
As a large country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a large country.
But if there is someone deceiving another person
I know Israel is doing this to us.
Is the previous American policy under the previous administration for or against me?
I don't think they want to imitate either Israel or America in this matter.
Also, if we take their policies, they are also under pressure from third parties.
In many cases, let me finish.
We understand and know that there are some dictates even for a large state.
What controls your policies?
We have no movement, the only thing that moves us is one thing.
Qatar's internal affairs are our internal matter.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will.
Sources of power: The island and Eid base.
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our faith in God and confidence
Or seeing His Highness the Amir of the Country.
We don't want to bother anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause any problems for anyone.
"We don't want to compete with anyone."
They can say whatever they want about great Qatar or any other country.
But we have a point of view.
First and foremost, we shut down and closed the Israeli office.
At first they said close the office, so we closed it, then they got upset and went to complain to the Americans. Can you believe these people?
Join the team called the Devil's Team.
What are they saying?
Americans and Europeans, and these are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
Conspiracies
What was done.
This is a flaw, we've reached a certain point and then what?
Tell me now.
In bullet points, how will you resolve the issue with Egypt?
And given that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it's important to look at him.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak was cautious about that.
But some of the crew
I need to leave.
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion, government, or others, or leading with illogical means.
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how this is going to happen.
And I know there is a time for reason.
And there will be time for us
If it were from me.
Or them
Great Arab interests brought them together.
One day we will find this.
You mean life is still going on.
It means we don't respond in the same Egyptian style you have.
If someone extends a hand to us, we give them an arm.
Now, Your Highness Sheikh
We never used to run.
Only on a solid basis are we ready to set off towards Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
There are many rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they are affected by this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or in important positions.
You know that it's not our usual practice to cancel jobs and appointments in this matter.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market where orders change, one is canceled and another is placed.
It's supply and demand, and there are other nationalities that have increased while some have decreased.
Okay, a quick answer.
The office was there.
We've disturbed the office, so it's best to leave now.
We had noticed that during the campaign days, all our losses in negotiations with Israel were due to this office.
So we blocked it. Let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And among them, it is our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign state.
So it was an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before when the relations, as they say, were good. We will honor her now; it's a bit difficult.
What reason would prompt you to reopen the office during this period?
The office will reopen when the reasons are over.
You have achieved great success.
Who made it as big as Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me be clear with you, our relations with America are strategic relations.
In some matters, this is it.
What is the most important thing?
In our region, there are matters that are pending resolution in some cases. We had disagreements with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration will be successful.
I am serious about advancing the peace process and serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny it.
What's happening in Iran, and what impact might it have on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among themselves
Using their usual methods, I'm sure they'll overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
Important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability for this region.
And we intervene whenever a party wishes to amend the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now I'm done, and all that's left is the strategic conversation between the president.
And Lebanese groups
About how to see.
As for Yemen, you have no role or they have just taken a stance.
Listen, it's known that we supported unity when most of the Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
And in the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet the Yemeni President.
I explained to him that our goal is the stabilization of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
And they did not respect this agreement, and I want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me
Did Qatar take this position and then get accused of paying money to Houthi and senior Yemeni officials?
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
And he who stands with unity does not stand against it.
Another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
We don't mind, but to be honest, I was shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, my master sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
The time has run out, but tell me briefly, these problems that happened to you because of your efforts to solve problems, will they change your policies in intervening in other Arabs' problems?
If only he would listen to me, I think there would be no need.
There was a big show once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have become fifty billion dollars, better than a headache.
But I say it with faith, because perhaps the time in the Arab world now
Not allowed under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Excellency the Ambassador.
It could even be exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's position.
What happened in the agreement in Doha.
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To authorize the committee and provide it with all the support.
To discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When there was Arab consensus
By going to New York, we were able to make a more balanced decision.
And we looked into that in Doha where both parties were concerned.
We tried our best not to hear it or be in it.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
"We are on the ground and know what the problem is after sitting with the Lebanese for long hours."
I believe it's a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I believe that Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region directly reflects on it.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to be this site.
With these conditions
Unfortunately
External repercussions
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is a problem, won't be the number one problem.
Alright, Sheikh, I know that perhaps the time is not now, maybe it's not the right time to talk about the scenes, but
What happened, you came here?
Somewhat paused in terms of interaction on Earth now.
I didn't even delay for a single second.
I know exactly what happened; even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke with His Highness
I told him if we go to Lebanon.
I will present the idea; His Highness agreed and supported it.
Where will all the leaders of Lebanon be present?
Because here in Beirut, you'll have to go to each of their neighborhoods.
While they are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
So we created this atmosphere, but from the start, it was our idea.
And that was the most important decision they both made.
Of course
And I felt this from the Arab League
So we must be honest brokers.
Praise be to God, I think this has proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides
To reach a dignified solution for both parties.
And that there will be a solution and no one will lose.
Before you make any move
The consultation took place at the Arab League and we found support.
What we've done
And I told him when we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he advised me.
To lock them and confiscate their mobile phones.
We were able to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee can't do anything.
Why were they looking for a solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred
And this is the time.
There is tension in Somalia and Sudan.
There are a lot of things happening in the world.
And every time we put out the fire.
It will be in the best interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign intervention.
And we try our best.
Sends forces
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point that needs to be discussed.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
I need a self-assessment in the Arab world.
Because of Arabic differences.
And any agreement between two Arab countries.
And we tried this.
In the Seventy-Three Days War
When Arabs agree on a solution to a problem
I think it's interesting.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
Seize wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because here in the Arab world, we face many great challenges.
Everyone plays in our courtyard.
We have no power nor strength.
And how can we stop playing in the square of Arab countries?
At least the minimum agreement among the Arabs.
Unfortunately, we complain.
While we watch
Our differences as Arabs and the absence of trust among us; trust is lacking between Arab countries.
Arab countries
Not so much a charge of treason as a kind of
Jealousy, what is the word?
This is a case that needs support from everyone, I mean, I think.
Okay, will you make this dream come true and actually call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
He butt in the conversation.
Is it possible for you to take on a role to mend the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if?
Eager to find solutions, and I am confident in their wisdom.
They may reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure of that, and with God's will, this will happen.
That relations have improved.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't be sure that this is what's happening now.
I'm sure if Arabs focus on solving the differences between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab call to wake up.
But what I can say is what happened in Lebanon.
The matter can be explained on the ground by an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation or other cases.
Will you still be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can only bring food and medicine.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and His Highness is always pleased.
There are more than one and a half million Palestinians under siege.
And we do not want them to have neither weapons nor support.
They do all this.
And there's no electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we only deliver food and medicine.
And our dispute with them may continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest first.
And he left the illusion.
The current Palestinian dispute is a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't comply.
This is a serious matter, they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
And they must even ask to go back to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
Resolve this dispute.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I wish there were a solution, but
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties that we
I won't be part of this, and we won't accept being part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests won't harm them or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Iran's cooperation with its peaceful neighbors
But when Your Highness says that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
No, never.
Present, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if that's okay.
Frankly, Your Highness, we were at an impasse, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
Some linked what happened to what they had announced.
The information might be disparate and unrelated, but that's what happened.
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, I know if he had specific dates before.
So you knew if there were negotiations.
Continuing to search for a solution
Undoubtedly, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And changing negotiation tactics.
These negotiations led to
To a positive outcome; we gathered some parties from certain quarters.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this paper.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the subject, subject by subject.
At the last moment, he overcame an obstacle that persisted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
I got rid of this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
You don't consider your role now.
Listen, the most important thing is that we stay out of the spotlight.
I have no territorial ambitions.
Or even control another state or something because our state
Our size... We are proud of ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving problems with our fellow colleagues.
But in the Arab world, it's very important.
To have countries that are
I want them to do something, and it's important.
Empowers some small nations to take on this role and supports them.
In some matters, they are excellent, in others good, and in some matters less than good.
The last question, Your Honor.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Security or repairing enmity
or confront Israel
We stop playing in the Arabic court.
We fix our problems in the Arab countries.
Choosing an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
Nationally and regionally
But if we become stubborn
Or he will have any hope.
Thank you very much, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
International efforts to end the war on Gaza
We start by requesting a meeting with the Council of the League of Arab States at the ministerial level.
As if you've changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Our brothers in Gaza faced... (the sentence is not complete in the original text)
Conditions require us to do a lot.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before
Not only through the Security Council resolution but also
Do not step on her or underestimate her.
Let me say it in another sentence.
We receive discipline.
That the street can no longer bear it, if we bear it as officials in the Arab street.
He won't bear it.
When we were in Egypt
There was written consent from ten to eleven.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
We consider it to the extent that there is an Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if, in a meeting, they might have a point of view.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important issue.
Because our goal is not propaganda and advertising, our goal is research.
So the summit ignored it.
So we ask ourselves
We'll press the poor other side.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's limit ourselves to the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
It was made clear that the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever is present.
We found that most of our brothers support the holding of the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I don't know what they mean by "moderation."
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation, if we go to any nation in Asia or Latin America.
Unsolved
Classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Will he abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No nation allows the intervention of good or evil.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
Can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
It was as if it was intended for us to get involved in an internal Arab fight.
Alright, then we'll go to the Security Council.
There is no Security Council resolution.
I hope that after Israel finishes its mission,
Well, the second Arab ministerial meeting you were invited to attend.
which was dominated by discussions, disputes, and intense altercations
There is an important point.
This is not what matters.
When we call for a meeting
Change stations
There's no peace now.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because at a party she tells you we have to wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Freezing peace talks with Israel.
We say we're at a party, you say we're going to lose in this thing.
In a greater loss than we've suffered now, but we were always respectful, polite, and adhered to decisions since the truce.
You say that squabbles are not important.
There was someone who wished for the destruction of Hamas and things like that.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a dispute between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to talk about others.
It is important for us to be men of ourselves and men of our state.
We implement our country's policies.
Who does this kind of thing on his behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What will his agenda be?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the difference here is if Israel implemented the decision immediately.
We can say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I'm sure there are difficulties.
Whether or not the international community asks her, and if that happens.
He will be shy.
The situation
See if they did something for the Jews and Israelis.
To get their rights
This is the current state of Arabs.
If the Arabs didn't go to the Security Council
They agreed to hold a summit and make decisive decisions.
And the Western countries will try for us.
Because we are in the Arab world and there are many people, and you can see how the Arab street reacts to this.
But this decision is important.
With the issue of contacting our chiefs one after another
In the end, they said it was nothing, which was a lie.
Okay, so if we're like Germany or others, are we demanding?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they initiated the attack, just say you have incorrect information.
And hundreds of thousands were killed.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, some of us.
Work hard on how.
For his contribution
In a way as if it were destiny and an act of God.
If the Arab nation says if they send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur.
Arabs considered or some considered Resolution 1860
And our colleagues worked hard to issue the decision.
Issued by the Security Council
What I want to say is, was it a victory or not?
And what will it lead to?
Let's assume that victory
What are we going to do?
We are supposed to adhere to the rest of the decision.
But I assure you that we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will agree with the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israelis rejected it, Israel came and agreed.
It means "so we" or "that means we" in English.
Do you have an alternative, or is it better for you to call for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation
At present, ready for any alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To make one group prevail over another in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start by trying to make plans.
Once they gathered, I don't know about Arab-European intelligence or something like that without mentioning names.
And when we agreed, I mean we participate.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The follow-ups because the Gaza problem started two years ago, not now.
I was going to talk about the topic two years ago, but specifically about the decision.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
Not issued and not implemented
We weren't invited.
They might think we have a different point of view.
It was required that everyone have the same point of view.
It's not necessary for everyone to have the same opinion, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, the parties involved were few.
The group that dominated another group that participated in the siege of Gaza.
Do you really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there?
About a real Arab conspiracy with all that's happening now in Gaza.
We are partially aware.
Let me tell you that we're not fully informed about the matter.
But I know.
Palestinian conflict
He was fed at the Arab and international levels.
And if they were charged, they wouldn't differ to this extent.
And after the elections...
And Hamas came and seized power.
By majority
We should have given them a chance and seen.
Do they want reform, or are they still revolutionaries who only know weapons and fighting?
But the day they came in
At the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not reach power.
Some say that there was an attack now.
Did Hamas, which broke the truce, or the Palestinians from Gaza, who broke the truce, make it?
Truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza remain suffering from hunger for two years.
No problem.
For reasons relating to Israel's security
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't concern me in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the rest of the people?
And then he should decide.
Either this or that, not every country has sovereignty in choice.
Our government
He is the main problem.
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If only we had worked hard, we had worked hard to ignite the conflict.
But it's clear that we've been asked to allow one group to dominate the other because this group...
We consider him a terrorist or we consider him...
All that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party to provide them with a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
Let's go back to the international and Arab efforts that were made to stop what is happening, according to what you said you were in favor of.
There is a Security Council resolution that has been rejected by Israel so far.
And there is the Egyptian Initiative One.
And Egypt in Cairo
Those Egyptian efforts
Absolutely, not an attempt to deceive.
This is required for an important role.
Egypt's borders are also with Israel and Palestine.
We
And we will not stop the chaos now.
In Gaza and we're trying to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the way to peace.
It must be
And so we always ask them for a big role.
What is it about?
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give a chance for success or for study.
I think his chances of success are slim.
If the two brothers in Egypt can
Bring Palestinian perspectives closer to each other.
And the person who needs to discuss the initiative is the affected party in Gaza.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1866 was issued.
This is an Arab Palestinian problem that we have.
We don't want to hear any side.
But I really wanted it, when the Palestinian delegations went.
And when they went to the league, they asked to have someone from Gaza with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
What we allow power to do
Our goal, not our policy, should be built.
Staying in power
The sheikh now.
I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative because I haven't gone through its materials yet.
Do you think that, in principle, this could be a mechanism to implement the international resolution of 1860 as some people have claimed?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow because
Every day that passes
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
Therefore, we do not want to delay or have the Israelis delay on this matter; when they finish their mission, we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt know this and feel cautious about it.
I want to clarify everything I said.
Now we have to solve the problem.
And not in the way Israel wants it to be.
The Turkish role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express?
Arab vacuum
Undoubtedly, it's a wonderful position.
And it has an Arab depth.
Accessible Entrance for Disabled Individuals (Arabic)
We know there is an Arab disability.
Part of it was due to conflicts.
Partly due to perspective, everyone believes their viewpoint is the best.
And others believe that their viewpoint is better.
And what is in the conscience, how can you make people respect and recognize that there is an Arab decision?
Or they'll chase us one after the other.
Another one says no, fine, we just give them two or three extra days to talk to them and bring the guys to be equal and solve the problem.
We need to rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have made mistakes, but we will deal with it.
At the Arab level
But still
At least we tell them no.
As part of the required function in Qatar, such as positions, we will return to this point later.
Also in the field at the same time I heard
Yesterday, Khaled Meshaal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement
First, there is no need for all that Sheikh Khalid Mash'al said, with all due respect and appreciation.
Why don't you sit with Khalid Mash'al and talk to him as Arabs?
Let's go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing conditions Israel also imposes conditions
Let them impose conditions, they are not allowed to impose conditions, while Israel can?
First of all, what do you think of this Arab gift?
Should we listen to this crowd who say De Gaulle didn't listen?
Completely different, first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
Whether with an ally or without, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
The present we're talking about
Is this an Arab gift that we're supposed to give?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
What you can fulfill from these required courses.
Many of those criticizing Qatar in this situation also demand
Regarding what's happening, the actor and the office are still open.
They speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
Severing ties, all connections, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They just want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
We
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, but in this decision and harder ones.
From this decision
We need a unified Arab stance.
For others
That no one sells another for moral or material gain, or calls it.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Good Chavez is a different subject. He has disagreements with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five permanent member ambassadors and arguments that these are films.
We're done with that, and the street is now better known.
With the high ceiling, Your Highness Sheikh.
Or do Lebanon's forces demand to confront the Israeli aggression, and so on.
Do you think that if it's framed within a single Arab framework, it might work?
But we call for an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"And that we encourage"
How will Syria, Lebanon, and other countries come together when there are Arab states that don't even talk to each other?
There must be.
Change in Arab relations
This is the current policy among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's already expired.
In goals
The important issue
And we know what the Lebanese structure is like.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
He gave an example if she returned her lands.
The situation in Gaza is different, they're still
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, I mean here Israel's goals mean the objectives of the operation for Israel.
One day he beats someone, another day he punishes someone, and another day he pleases someone.
An example of that is what happened in Lebanon for them; it's not a good example for them.
A sample solution that happened in Lebanon.
He considers it good.
To Gaza
The problem in Gaza or Palestine, their solution is easier than the solution in Lebanon.
Should we reclaim our land today or tomorrow, those who differ with each other?
Their differences over power
On the distribution of power.
That differs because they are closer in thought.
More than a Lebanese intellectual.
So the solution is much easier.
And here's the problem.
Your Eminence, Sheikh
We only have two minutes if we want to solve the problem in its likely place.
And diplomat
How can this process end?
I am a Palestinian from Gaza.
Let me tell you.
Or reject
and help
Agree with us
There will be an Arab failure.
In strategic terms
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Not before, not now, why?
The problem is not so much about taking the initiative as it is about how we feel.
We help those who solve the problem, without mentioning the name of Qatar because some people have issues with mentioning Qatar.
No need to organize a summit, as there is already a summit scheduled for March.
If we launch an initiative, we'll be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And do not impose on them pressures.
Because history won't spare us if we pressure them.
We are going through this initiative, we saw all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress and wish that our Arab brothers will help as much as possible in this matter.
And we hope to push him out of the competition.
Arab Competition
In heating up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at one point.
And these are our problems, well, we fight among ourselves and disagree.
I don't want to do this.
In Kuwait next month on the nineteenth, I believe of course that the Arab situation
As you know, as mentioned, and as explained by your Excellency.
Does the entire Arab climate help? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
And of course, any summit held in a brotherly country, we attend.
And we have no objection to attending any summit.
But I'm not afraid to be a political peak.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
It's too late even if it's in ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they have been beaten for twenty-five days?
Will be
They say the Arabs couldn't meet?
We said that it
We said that it
With all due respect, this summit has been scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In our own unique way
Therefore
Enter into peace.
And say, "This is it, the truth."
For this meeting
Thank you to the audience for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues. Goodbye.
A few days ago, there was a celebration for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law in particular
She was also a member of several local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He has also delivered over seventy-five lectures, workshops, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
Initially, let's agree on the term currently in use.
Should we refer to people with disabilities as "special needs" or, as you said, "people with disabilities"?
Good evening first.
Taken from a culture of human rights or a culture of human rights because people with disabilities
Because he treated people with disabilities as humans first.
Human
Then that led to his disability in trying to adapt to society.
The medical concept was prevalent at that time.
Approach the concept.
Special education and training appeared.
This category became
That's why we started calling them people with disabilities.
What are the standard rules that were relied upon?
The special rapporteur's role is to monitor the implementation of this document.
And accelerate the pace until the emergence of the international agreement, which was legally binding and distinguished by the rules in this regard.
And he set a fundamental condition or basic rule in this term.
Who treats these people as humans, as people.
With the change in terminology as mentioned, is there a shift in the perception of this group within society?
Yes, and it is measured in a certain way.
This varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this
That the Arab world was distinguished or differed.
However, legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably lack of financial resources.
Of course, that's what I wanted to say, that culture exists but sometimes lacks resources and sometimes lacks political will.
Sometimes regulations, but
But unfortunately, awareness is a bit low, and there is also no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developed countries are of working age.
And suffers from unemployment
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or in the presence of mines and weapons
Men are one degree better.
Add disabilities, they will be in remote areas and far-flung regions.
Therefore, there are many directions for organizations working in this field and trying to raise awareness.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of creating numerous religious centers of some sort
They went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
This is one of the things that, praise be to God, we achieve through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
To develop an agenda
Or incorporate the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to include those centers.
In light of the deteriorating situation of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't say that and agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to the state of disability.
Embedded within the social context and within the political and economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be
While they are among the marginalized groups
In a country like I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot absolutely confirm that there is no improvement in the situation.
And it has actually been implemented on the ground, and if I can give an example, I would say...
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
People with disabilities experiencing health issues are covered under this strategy and there are other programs as well.
What we also tried to guarantee
On the ground with organizations
Kamal Kirro is with us now from Syria, hello.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Soliman Kirro, excuse me, please come in, Soliman.
My best regards to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
First, is there a mental barrier within the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual disability means that a person who was previously healthy became a victim of what turned into a factor of pressure leading to intellectual impairment.
My son was left disabled due to torture and imprisonment. He suffered brain damage and is still receiving treatment. It's been six years now.
I know that there are around four hundred children and disabled people in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
Because they know as they know their children.
And all the meaning without making themselves.
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people...
Some of them are apostates or do not follow Islam, wisdom is not taken from them.
Thank you very much, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
Let's go back to our guest for a comment.
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any mental disability.
Yes, it is among the world's classifications.
Of course, intellectual and mental disability as they are called
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or hearing impairments, and physical disabilities.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
The verb and the reaction that occur within a social context.
In the Arab world or any other provinces
Certainly, addressing the disability took a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
I, for example, during my experience and work as a Special Rapporteur, was trying to address and work on certain issues.
In other words, it's everyone's right.
So they can provide it to them.
and various rehabilitation aspects to ensure their ability to attend school as well as organize work.
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, there are in this international committee
Me too, I mean as a special rapporteur.
The fact that my work was positive for me does not mean it was directly related.
That supported this position.
I've seen her at many meetings, for example, the international conference.
Rights of persons with disabilities
Disabled by these constraints or these shortcomings
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
Unfortunately, the United Nations somewhat delayed that during the preparation and drafting.
Regarding institutions and agencies
For example, and I'll end with this.
World governments and non-governmental organizations are members of the United States.
We took another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
Knowing to what extent programs for people with disabilities are on their agendas.
If there are budgets, if there is involvement of people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues
We're taking more calls, we're now joined by Meshri Naji from Algeria, hello Naji.
You too
I wanted to ask my sister who was supposed to be blamed exactly.
I wanted to ask, I am originally physically disabled.
Okay, we'll direct this question to Naji Mechri from Algeria, thank you very much Ahmed.
The Greek from Aleppo, hello.
Good evening, ma'am. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare Housing Seasonal clothing Even taking them in seasonal tourism And this is what happens in Europe
Is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
All we're talking about is unproductive debate. Thank you.
Sister Hessa mentioned the financial shortage.
In poor countries, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, I demand...
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profits of every organization in the world.
It must be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
The shortage will contrast with the disability of many people with disabilities and war victims, etc.
Many thanks to Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and mentioned his problem of being disabled.
At the local or national level, meaning across Algeria.
Needs within the community must be met within that community.
The same rights that anyone else should enjoy.
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health and education.
Therefore, I truly call from this platform, especially Arab governments,
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are within the existing agendas.
No, there's no need to create new devices.
To meet the needs of the disabled person or not to meet them if the state does not need to.
They must already be committed to performing.
I advise him first to return and refer to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it is at a national level and should be within this scope.
You mentioned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but there are many countries that have signed it but are not committed to it.
And here we have a caller's question: Why are there no laws?
It is a confirmed fact that we are in a human society, which means there are a lot of mistakes and a lot of truths.
Of course, many agreements and certainly many treaties do not contain a literal obligation in them.
Or ideal commitment by many countries that have acceded to many such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know it.
But the question of the adoption and organization of the agreement for this purpose
First, we will ensure at least the existence of awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Officials then gradually develop until they reach the entire society.
Also the issue of our commitment to reporting and conveying these reports to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of consciousness.
To the reports that I worked on as a rapporteur at the United Nations were...
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
So there is a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
For I give advice, encourage, and call out.
It is also important that people with disabilities
And we'll hear what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, the president of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute, has to say to us.
Mr. Naji Sagherneh will speak about that. Welcome, Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
With me, Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
And concerned with the chairmanship of Her Highness Sheikhaha Hessa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As a deaf person from Qatar
As president, Sheikh Hassa actually had a long history.
And the international treaty you are referring to now is in fact
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
That these countries implement this international agreement.
That would be useful for people with special needs, it is essential that
Really having someone who can activate this agreement in all states.
Obaid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
Let's stop.
Here we continue our discussion after a short break. Stay with us.
Share your opinions on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and a variety of other topics.
SMS service through Al Jazeera Live
Dear viewers, we welcome you once again and our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability is an international fund for support.
Disability and the obligation of all countries to provide funding, what is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Regulatory Compliance Monitoring Mission
Since I worked there for six years, there was no meaningful support.
Only from China and Austria
And it always means that I thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my own, Qatar.
The one who established the office, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
I mean like the one we raised at the beginning, and this point is always mentioned.
Terms of Ordinary People
So how is taking care of people with disabilities or caring for the disabled referred to?
It means that if there was a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all circumstances, in all categories
People with disabilities, refugees, and displaced children and women.
All this we may indeed bring to a point called
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And there are these voices that always demand and never get tired or weary.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't we allocate a part, sorry.
In favor of these programs and projects
As he has presented, and I truly thank him for this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what you told me regarding the payment of financial dues.
Does the funding to assist people with disabilities cover developing countries and Arab states only, or not?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person before me, the Swede, yes.
Also some countries of the European Union
Certainly there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that may not have been.
So far, aware of the existence of this special course
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
In the Arab region, unfortunately, there were many promises, but unfortunately only one state was established.
We'll only talk about the Arab region.
We have more calls with Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Hamad, hello.
Peace be upon you
And you too
Hello, Dr. Sheikhah Hessa
Almost ten
We noticed that this girl was suffering from a psychological disability.
What is your role regarding the girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
I mean sometimes even when we persist
What is your role for the girls of Qatar's children?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, Karwan Behjat from Kuwait, hello.
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we leave our oil in his murky waters?
Those with special needs, we can count them.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
By boosting individual morale
And spend in this noble cause.
This if we are truly believers.
Thank you and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as a Special Rapporteur.
With our profound gratitude and appreciation to her, and thanks to the State of Qatar for all it has provided for people with special needs.
Many thanks, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
Peace be upon you too.
And to your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level may result from inbreeding within families.
I think it's a large percentage.
What leads to disability.
Thank you very much, Flag Bearer Chérif from Tunisia, now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where does a girl with a mental disability go?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
Of course, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities such as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
For schools
There was previously
And I don't mean private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The standard-bearer Sharif from Tunisia pointed to something very important.
And scientific papers and the like.
From disability organizations' programs only, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All these efforts attracted many campaigns and programs towards reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
Adopts healthy strategies
Based on consciousness.
To demonstrate the risks of consanguineous marriage
And genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but it surely needs time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a reaction to it, but there needs to be some kind of legal commitment.
Yes, Karwan Behjat inquired and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab states.
To help people with disabilities, let me first
Yes, there is a statistical estimate carried out by the World Health Organization for the world as a whole.
There are forty or approximately forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers double.
Like studying in South Africa where they saw and proved.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, three people are disabled.
And since the Arab region became the undisputed region of conflicts
Even the suggestion that Karwan Behjat offered.
One percent is not enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups
Frankly and sincerely, I don't think it fits.
Those requiring processing of their problems and needs
He emphasized that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
What governments usually do is not considered inclusive of people with disabilities.
Right, and these are related to the culture and societal restrictions sometimes.
When the census is conducted by
Stakeholders
There is a disabled person in the house.
The only question that was asked was whether there was a disabled person or not.
The relevant department and the concerned individuals therein
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend getting more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, whether male or female.
Did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the figures are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
Care and attention must also be advanced, Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar, we welcome Fatima.
And peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a disabled child.
And I thank His Highness the Ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, for embracing this category.
I am very proud to receive all this care and attention.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Messaferi Hello
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much, Laylah Al-Misferi from Qatar, for joining us.
Abdulkareem is from Jordan, hello Naseem
Come on, Kareem, let's hear you.
And peace be upon you too.
God bless you, to be honest, I have an intervention.
First of all, I am a sound engineer and I have worked in the State of Qatar for about four years.
We had a month of awareness for speech and hearing problems.
We held conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns for the hearing impaired.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, I lived there for almost three years now.
Frankly, it provides new and good services.
Frankly, he provides new services, whether they are material, non-material, or moral conditions.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutions as well.
They receive good support.
Present, Karim. Do you have a direct question? It's just due to time constraints, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, the services are wonderful, and I think they are excellent.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Relevant to the subject.
I will also return to the topic of the agreement.
Which are binding once the ratifications are obtained and the accession is made.
As a duty of the state or these institutions
Because it depends on the issue of the rights of these people, regardless of
And frankly, what?
What can be done during that period for people with disabilities and why?
And you're wishing it would happen now.
Of course, I hope so too.
I hope that this will be a measure in this research or survey and lead to higher-quality research in this field.
It also became clear to me through this experience.
Six years of experience
Coordination among Arab countries as well.
They also have a role, it's not just about rights, they get rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability Thank you.
We now have with us the presenter from the League and Cup Channel, Lana is on the line, good morning Lana.
I am also happy to welcome the bright Captain Ali Qasim in Umm Salal.
Hello, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Everyone can congratulate publicly, Lana, please.
I had a studio open for five hours, and the day before it was for two hours.
I congratulate Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens; they deserve this international achievement.
I may have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana. You are in the field of sports and one of the experts in this area, and very knowledgeable about these lines and this field.
Because even our file
A competitor, which means we deserve the six-point difference between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
This was because our file was rich, comprehensive, and supported by numerous ambassadors, well-supported, for example, by the stadiums.
Some people might have been afraid, perhaps a certain percentage, like in America.
Some countries might be willing, don't need to provide venues, and prepare some projects specifically for this event.
Because they're already ready.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
I expect that to impact economic, political, and health sectors.
But, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course, it's a great achievement especially for us, you even saw how the non-athletes were very happy.
Insha'Allah, Ali, tell me about the moment the winner was announced.
I was coming out of practice and we were listening to the radio station.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
And you're driving the car and listening to the radio.
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course we had the sunroof open.
My friend's body flew off the top of the car.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we turned on the lights and started our own party.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on this event a great deal.
Lana, of course you were involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what were their reactions?
Many media outlets and channels from around the world were there.
He became a leading teacher, very clear on the map, and Qatar became famous.
Of course, Ali, having the player on the team is very important.
And I believe it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Is Ali there? Do they recall the required specifications for joining the league?
There are more sports events coming up now.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
He who has basic principles and well-planned football tactics.
So what are the rules and foundations that the player should be characterized by?
I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Difficult and continuous training and discipline.
All these are basic things that help him focus all his efforts on games or training.
I believe every stage has a unique advantage.
It has a unique sensation and taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, and where do you find yourself?
Wonderful
It helps you maintain your physical fitness and teaches you how to keep healthy through exercise, that's the important part.
Everyone also watches football matches, you'll automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Are people working in the media limited to one side?
What confines you to one part, isn't it?
It's an open field, not just football.
They're all sports, but sports are great.
Ali, there are also some other important issues we would like to discuss.
Would you wish to go back ten years to reach 2022?
Yes, what were you wishing for?
Of course, now everyone dreams of this, especially since it's the World Cup, now any player
Anyone who watches a World Cup match will be happy, and even more so if they are playing in the World Cup.
I hope they meet the expectations and that it's their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I just said, I'm currently on vacation, but
His return to the leagues after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You had a beautiful comment from Qatar TV and lovely memories.
Insha'Allah, Qatar TV will become like the university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
Our Dorina is brave, and God willing, we will win many different awards.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How is your situation there? How are you? I hope you are well.
Of course, Alhamdulillah, frankly
Of course, yesterday, in the studio, we talked about many players.
So I think some of the young people who were following us think you are...
Required
It is very common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I have a good chance in Umm Salal, *as an exhibition*.
I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
And my situation with the team is very good.
How can we make sports a social issue?
And unlike Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
Everything connects, everything complements sport.
Women play a role in all areas of sport.
Every individual, whether young or adult in this society, recognizes the importance of sports.
About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is enough.
We have more new generations.
Generations grow up, but we need to foster a generation aware of sports from an early age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is an active building.
It is important for new generations of athletes.
We just need to be decisive and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the various club competition matches?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem we face in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association has yet to find a way to attract the public.
What method should we use to attract them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending the studio.
Media plays a fundamental role, by the way, in the public's abstention.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the football federation has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs %pw, some club management organizes some activities and events.
For the audience, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
Players, I mean the new generation.
To love what they do and believe in their abilities, and as I said, they need not only financial support, but also moral support, which is much more important.
Thank you very much for this wonderful interview, God willing.
So we'd love to hear your final word on Qatar's win to host the 2022 World Cup, Lana, please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
We hope, Captain Ali, that this will be your final word you wish to say in this interview.
Congratulations and I wish you continued success.
Thank you, Captain and Knowledgeable Player. I wish you success in your sporting progress and life. God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people say that these songs are popular these days; nevertheless, they have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English words.
Today we're discussing this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We'll get to know them better through the interview that brings us together directly.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new type of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scene.
I'm from the West, particularly America, which is where rap comes from.
Before we start talking about rap music,
There is boldness in using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can rap.
To write the lyrics of songs,
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
So we came to know all these important and crucial details from two people who have a strong presence in this field.
They formed a great band.
Yusuf Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning, Yusuf.
Hello everyone, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We discover that rap didn't exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Speaking on behalf of the citizen.
Including joy, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I believe, are from the artist who paints a picture and the poet who writes a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any musical instrument.
Do you think Qatari society, Gulf society, accepts this type of language?
Two thousand and ten
Do you feel that people like buying CDs for rap music?
Different ages
There are families and many people who are hearing more than ever before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are in this band so far?
This means you can all say words, write poetry, and perform rap.
As you say, the singer, the rapper,
He's the one who sometimes plays, write the words.
Ah, enough!
I ask that he listen and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs you produced from Salman, from Yusuf, from anyone in the same band.
I didn't think it would be on a CD and available in stores.
But you know, if I'm the only one, it means I have to produce the album and release it on the market, which is difficult in terms of commercial recording and procedures.
Well, why didn't you think of that? You're twenty-five years old, and one hand can't always clap alone.
There must be two of you, God willing, you have twenty-five hands, God protect you, all of you are like young men and brothers.
You can create a CD and market it through multiple websites online.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think he has thirteen songs.
Registration isn't like it is now.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
Its quality is poor, not like now, but clear.
He made almost fifty CDs.
There's rap, I can't say it wasn't around because maybe some young people knew this art form ten years ago.
Not as strong as the record and I think the distribution during this time, the situation is different now.
Especially since there is diversity in music, and a wide range of techno music genres nowadays.
These young people and these artists produce a collection of wonderful songs.
We would also like to talk about the concerts you participated in.
See, the party we attended in Doha was one of a kind.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
We sneaked in to see the audience.
We were amazed; we didn't expect such a large number.
We were also surprised by the presence of more families.
More than the youth
The organization was excellent.
We were a bit nervous because it was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect such a large turnout.
The audience interaction was amazing.
It took a long time, there were so many songs.
Okay, let's hear something, or a song lyric that you wrote, which the audience, especially the youth, love.
Let's hear some words, so we can show the audience.
Can we listen to it directly?
Take your time.
Go ahead, Salim.
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program.
One of the nice things about the program is that it runs in the morning.
Salman is an expert, this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't love it
They have no idea about him.
The words are random.
Okay, of the songs you've presented, give me some of your previous lyrics.
See, not all songs are random, or what they call in English, "freestyle".
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my homeland, good morning to the Dawah program.
We are live on television, for the audience.
To see what one two one will offer
Together from Doha's morning
The beautiful song I just heard
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate that. When will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes for themselves.
He won't find it easy to perform.
So everyone writes.
Of course, I believe that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can also write about it because he loves sports.
Or love of the homeland
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, Qatar's youth are represented.
Doha awaits its moment to shine as it hosts the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
To celebrate this event
We are live-streaming this video.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch these live clips together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha Airport this morning to continue.
Preparations for hosting the massive continental event
Let's go back to our guests, Youssef and Salman, whom we are happy to have with us.
They are an Arab Gulf rap group, right?
Can we call it that way?
Currently, frankly, we
They are preparing for a party, but it's not certain.
But, you are working on a party that will, God willing, announce Youssef.
Insha'Allah, but this is not certain, we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your journey. I wish you good luck, and rest assured that our program will support you from the bottom of our hearts.
Also, Salman, where are you all gathering, twenty-five people?
Where do you meet, and how do you bring all the ideas together?
Sure, there are some shared songs.
It's not necessary for anyone to be Salman or Youssef or any of you to sing a whole song.
There must be joint cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's difficult to gather twenty-five in one place.
I start calling Youssef and the other men and ask them to gather in one place.
Take into account the song and the lyrics.
And there's a second method.
I'm doing my part.
He continues.
So he records and sends it back to me.
And see other experiences
Collect some CDs by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experiences and techniques?
Of course, we always
Artists have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn the techniques, and try to come up with a unique style.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone and the same expressions,
We're not producing anything new, we want to do something that is...
So we can benefit a little from them.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
In a primitive way, let's watch the report together so we can benefit and enjoy it, let's watch it together.
These talents that some people possess are mysterious.
Using very primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dail
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh.
He has good experience and ability.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
Deeper than one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate location to dig the well, but with the expert, can.
Discover, locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our parents and grandparents
They were seeking help from experts to locate the wells.
digs
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
Not modern techniques
Soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
They are underground tables.
Pomegranate seeds
Pomegranate branches or fig branches
Now, the process of discovering water tables is applied scientifically.
To close, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Go back
From here, we start marking.
And here, the current ends.
Requires a lot of experience and patience.
To enable the understanding of the sensitivity of motion
I've been to many places.
Ninety-five percent of success.
Of course, this way and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
What is really surprising is the success rate of those practicing this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Glory to God, who taught man what he did not know. This report is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The one who has his own band and more than one CD album.
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries such as Qatar vs Bahrain and Qatar vs Kuwait.
They release stronger songs with a stronger theme.
Addressing an issue, among others, there are many matters.
See me as a role model.
Inshallah
And at the same time, we want to
Played a wide range of songs
As much as possible
Once in a while, let's keep in touch with you.
To keep up with the band's latest news
But let's emphasize the band's name.
It's the rappers.
Let's go back to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful atmosphere.
We are live with you through this direct link.
Wherever you were in Konrich, you were receiving the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
Deals with various social and psychological issues of youth.
But we only have two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, hello again.
Sometimes subscriptions expire.
We tried to contact the company, but no one responded.
As a team, you have to develop yourself, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
You'll find us among the first search results.
Organize and cooperate together in this great production.
You merge and match images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or just upload it to YouTube and video-sharing websites so people can watch.
There are some, we've done this before.
There are a lot of songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company to adopt you and the lack of a website.
You really need a place where you can all come together as a band.
What are your wishes, which you hope to fulfill and achieve?
Whoever protects us.
And arrange an album for us.
I hope it becomes official.
Because we spent five years.
Like a grain, no more.
Yes, we've collaborated on some things, on some series.
We hope it improves.
And to have someone who supports us and stays with us.
Yes, Salman, we also want to know what your wishes are.
My only wish is to produce a video.
We wish you success.
We hope that all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
And it bears a message, as I just said.
Good luck, I wish you all the success.
Say hello to the group, and we wish you good luck.
We'll wrap up with the song they produced especially for the show.
This is the program of KD and DJ MREldoha.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KG Ms. Bobo with a hot SCT 1 on the body.
We can say, good morning my homeland, good morning to the medicine program.
We are live on television, for the audience.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30, everyone must watch.
To see what one two one will offer
Together from Doha's morning
A product of good grace, presented by Shima Al-Hamadi.
The manager is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Rabee Qatar, of course.
It can be repeated and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a shopping trolley.
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in...
A large screen will appear displaying the components of this product.
It was also a great and feasible idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart detects the item.
And made shopping easy for the buyer.
He can bring up all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
Full details
Or ambitious, for example there are a number of projects, about four or five.
The one who deals with traffic issues.
It addresses the problem of traffic congestion and other issues such as parking problems, and it was very creative and beautiful.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if I should mention some of the projects that were presented or not.
For example, for underground transport, the great idea is
As soon as the man leaves his house, he finds an elevator.
And converge at a single point.
I assume that all viewers are enjoying the images they are seeing now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, it's like an ATM, for example.
For women, for example I have a card
I go in and say I need a t-shirt.
This is, for example, some shops, or if you lose things at home, like the key.
This is lost, for example, the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza.
Her Highness
At an early age, this is of great importance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
We also invited speakers and orators.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To present their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve the main idea.
Children's skills are diverse and numerous.
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaboration with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
It's all a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in developing such talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Innovation Center for Girls and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers played a very big role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And training children on them.
Engaging and encouraging children, with each program relying on institutional partnerships.
According to the importance of projects and institutions
What's changing?
Our presence here in Katara gives us a strong boost and support.
And faster.
We are now, in collaboration with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially what relates to reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
We are running it, especially since we are in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, future generations, and youth
What is the last word you want to say to the families and children watching us now and interested in joining the center?
Who are we giving this to now?
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't underestimate.
We must take their ideas into consideration, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we encourage the child to think.
It is important to pay attention to child care and their concerns.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
Encourage him, for we encourage the family.
To pay more attention to the child's imagination, today's children are the roots of the future.
Take a tour of the exhibition and while watching their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
Dreams turn into reality, many have come true and become a reality.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there success.
Our hearts are with you.
Inshallah
Of different ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
He is considered a pioneer and deserves to be implemented.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the Children's Cultural Center as well.
Mr. Abdullah, please briefly tell us about the exhibition.
There were a lot of activities, indeed, what can you say about them?
Children introduced a new style of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their country.
Was under the patronage of the Honorable Minister of Education
On the tour of the exhibition
He will grow up until he is twenty or thirty.
We started training children on Qatar's Vision 2030 across all three themes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in the years twenty and thirty.
Then, start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to be innovative.
I suppose they already have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will grow more and more.
Sir, I launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of Generations"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt it when we were strolling with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for twenty thirty.
A child thinking about twenty years ahead.
They express their love for their countries in the field that matters to them.
There must be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
They were also the first-prize winners from the Arab League.
Of course, all children
On the side, there were various shows in a specific schedule.
To present the projects they have done.
There is a large attendance, a very unique attendance.
Stars of science
Some of the winners in the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
The innovative or creative forest or reserve.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also one of the children's dreams and hopes for Qatar's future.
This is an idea for twenty or thirty.
How can a child contribute with a creative idea for twenty to thirty?
The main idea is that there's a chip in the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee can monitor the ball's movements.
Or the field is changed by this electronic slide.
The one who is playing soccer.
There are creative ideas, of course, the main idea, some people might ask.
And projects
We always say, "We've reached this stage."
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
Give them confidence in how to present the project, handle the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, connected to something he enjoys, all of this is an achievement.
He provided support, we thank him for that.
Which is now in the development stage.
Also the public, the committee and some responsible persons supported the projects.
First, no, it was the second, because this girl
Pipes, channels for the audience to attend underground, and the way viewers enter need arrangements.
A very large protected forest.
Where visitors can wander and see animals and reptiles.
Also, there is a sensor attached to some animals to examine their condition.
There is also the marine environment, and the way to enter is also creative.
One of the reasons she won was her vast and detailed imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
There's also one that talked about an underwater tourist city.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
And many ideas of tourism.
Very interesting
Perhaps this is what their minds need, at this time, maybe in twenty or thirty years.
In the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects.
It was adopted by the science club, and they said these are the projects we need to work on.
In his project, the water that is not needed from air conditioning.
Let's see the Arab newspaper.
The article says, "Qatar University celebrates graduation."
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Humaid.
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
And Dr. Sheikhah bint Abdullah Al-Maneai, President.
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and Calgary University
There are also great news about our students.
It is an educational achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
He is considered one of the young actors who are making a strong entry into the Qatari drama scene.
How long, also classification and colored threads.
Actor Abdelhamid Sharshani is considered one of the actors who made themselves.
If convincing,
He won't be chosen to be part of the projects carried out within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdelhamid Sharshani is participating in the series Killer Feelings and Recordings Part Two.
We're happy to have him as our guest this morning.
So that we can talk to him about his involvement in these two works and his overall experience.
Hello with us and good morning
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning Show. This is the first time I'm meeting you, and it's your first time on Doha Morning.
With the people who work hard on the program
And you, Madame Lisa.
Welcome! It's great to have you with us. Before we start our discussion,
Okay, let's continue.
I am a responsible and executive man.
I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them, if anyone agrees that you don't return the bisht.
Of course, I have another question as an introduction, but since we've seen this part of the series, let's classify it as part one.
He pointed out that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais with the city of Marrat.
A lot of things and information about that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we'll watch this excellent report from our colleague Abdurrahman Marshud.
Let's see it together.
So this is surely a testimony from people who know about flattery or favoritism.
And as evidence of the history of this city or that.
As much as we see of its effects and what we hear about it from its poets and their tales.
Their classical and modern history, hence this comes as an important document added to the city's record.
One Mirror City is one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient city founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how it was named?
Some believed he was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the river that is named after him.
Its founding date is unknown.
In the Age of Ignorance
The most famous thing in the city of Marrat is Mount Comet, which has been the subject of many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close by.
The ruins. These are historical sites.
This teacher is considered one of the tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia.
The municipality of Mara'a has made enormous efforts in industry.
A garden on top of this mountain.
And seating areas for locals and everyone in the kingdom.
It was named after the companion of the Prophet, Khalid bin Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the liar
One of its ancient features is the Kumat River.
It's a place where stream waters gather and are stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
From its ancient monuments, as well as the Al-Dawahi Heritage House.
Marat is a city that dates back to pre-Islamic times.
He was renowned for his poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain, Jebel Akhdar.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed for the Doha Morning Program
Muras City, north of Riyadh
We return once again to our dear guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about those methods and techniques.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is very unique.
We open a file for him and he is registered with a special record in our system.
Email to his guardian
This report contains the extent of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guard gets a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's record.
To register his son online.
He sees his son's progress.
He can see his grades and communicate with teachers.
So that we can truly appreciate the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
So we can bring most of the children to the center and send them our best regards.
The one who registered at this center with a teacher there.
So that we can assess her intelligence and the level she has reached since she joined the center.
Of course, this year.
Focus on one task and after Ramadan.
But this effect, of course, always works at the expense of other works.
Some people just watch TV in Ramadan.
He stays up late watching TV while people change their worship months with TV.
Reduce, reduce, reduce the chain, reduce, let them work on one project every two years, is that better?
Of course.
I hope they like me in Ramadan.
But I would like to send you all my greetings.
"Insha'Allah" (God willing)
And with games too.
From drama to fashion
A fashion show was held in Katara, the Cultural Village.
Of course, we continue with you with great love and sincerity.
And develop the abilities and skills of children more.
In a manner different from the various schools in this generous country.
We have a model and we spoke with our guest who was with us before.
Now we have Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam welcoming us and saying good morning.
How are you, Omnia?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
Omniya is an example of that.
We will try with her the next technique or method that Ms. Naseem mentioned.
Do you feel there's a difference in his mind?
Do you feel that these skills and techniques,
The matter doesn't change regarding his mental skills or even his educational level.
Scientific methods
This includes initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure the level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now there's going to be a test or something like that.
Amana will be taking and answering calls live on air.
Of course, Amany knows nothing about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course, I have another question to start with,
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the series of classifications of the first part,
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky with several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distribute roles with CEO Ashraf Shahah with Mr.
It's Tara's opportunity to produce art.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
I have more than one episode where I'll be playing different characters.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this work, we have...
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Ghareer.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Asam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two works a year.
This could be the reason I asked you before you went on air. You've been acting since 1997.
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition to act.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I chose acting as my talent. The person who supported me at the beginning was the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who considers me like his son.
If you need anything, call me.
We were in all of his shows.
We worked hard, praise be to God.
Now, without Tara, many, many thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, very, very thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If we compare in Kuwait, in Kuwait, every year, twelve to sixteen new actors come up. Why?
They have it.
Of course, thank her very much for providing many opportunities.
But, let's say,
Let's talk about the second series, we had an idea about octaves.
We need to know about the killer instinct.
And the foot.
We have a sample, and with us is the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tamimi.
Until this action takes place in the air.
And we can see how we treat people. Let me first say good morning to Mr. Sabhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Welcome and peace be upon you.
Let's start with you, sir, please.
God willing
In the name of God
We hold hands.
We see the nerves.
It's like a painting or a message from God Almighty that shows all the parts of your body.
From the inside and its problems.
Sometimes you feel dizzy.
I have a headache and I feel dizzy.
Loosen your hand, loosen it. Let your nerves relax, yeah.
By doing this, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something specific from his hand that he suffers from a certain disease.
From his left side. His ears, he has a non-severe ear infection in the middle ear.
"I'm in pain! What do you mean, Mr. Abdulaziz?"
Ear. Do you have a problem with your ear?
Since the day I was born, I have been a child.
Do you have pain here as well?
It's the sinuses around the nose!
Do you have a pain in the nose and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a sinus problem around the nose.
It gives him a headache between his eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
Your thyroid gland isn't working properly, you feel tired and sluggish all the time, and you feel like your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either oversleeping or laziness, you always feel sluggish.
You always have tonsillitis.
In it. See the vibration, you notice the vibration.
He's stressed and you never walk barefoot, maybe it's the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this massage also beneficial for children?
The mother's thumb, praise be to God, is the size of a child's palm.
Most children aren't sleeping, why?
What he carries is what he loves to move, but people think he loves to move. He has gases in his stomach, bless you.
When the mother puts her thumb, by extending the thumb.
In the palm of the child's hand
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to them.
Let's see it so that every mother can learn this move.
You're going to start pushing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This is about the child, about, about, about the child and he is sweet.
Okay, regarding discoveries, you have specific discoveries related to women.
As we said, in every house, there are ninety percent of women, may God protect them.
First thing, first warning is from ceramics to even the foundations.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, it's fine to walk barefoot, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof is that when ceramics are used in homes, health problems increase.
Because it's cold and chilly.
When there was a carpet, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
It has increased.
Women should be careful to focus on walking barefoot on the heels.
This is the foot and ankle area at the back, the ankle.
From here, this foot and now down the heel.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Focus with me for a bit.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just be present in the delivery month.
This means they don't go out on the eighth. The eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be careful when walking barefoot.
If she's on time.
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan: "And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will let fall fresh dates upon you."
We already know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her provision comes to her.
I even discussed it with scholars, and they told me: "Why change the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?"
I told them, "I give you the idea that God placed in this science as He inspires me."
Shake the palm tree trunk towards you, when you shake the tree, how does it look?
He's sharp like nails or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, it gives an order to the wombs, which is the area of the wombs, here in the middle.
It is the entrails. It gives orders to facilitate childbirth and reposition the fetus.
Elevating the fetus's head or repositioning it so that it comes out naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
And he takes the hand and begins to relax it.
Some consider it a practice, others recognize it as a science.
So, they're afraid to tell you and you don't believe them.
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I'd like to ask you one last question because time has flown by so quickly.
If anyone wants to get in touch with you, any person who wants to communicate with you, do you have a specific email address or...?
Okay, the mobile number is available in the control room. If anyone wants to communicate with Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, on Qatar TV there are numbers, so that he can communicate with us and take this number.
I exist only to serve people.
If we believe this faith, God will bless your work and lead people.
I have sins like other people and do everything you can imagine. I'm an ordinary person.
Nevertheless, we aspire to more good.
We always think of good.
Viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
Also through the foot.
We saw a live model where diseases in a person were detected.
And what he suffers from. I hope we can benefit from you, and if anyone wants to communicate with him, they can read about him online.
The way it will be implemented, whether in the coming days or years, or if it includes more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
The fact that obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So we were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth state with them.
This program, frankly, happened to be the first lady in New York.
I visited Doha, and they have a program for this.
They showed it to us, we adopted it, and said it was fine.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can notice the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
He's quitting exercise.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone (proverb).
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience. Praise be to God, we are at the end today.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida,
Raquia Independent Girls' School
And with high spirits.
The family was more conscious, and their siblings were enthusiastic at home and started eating this food like them.
The student becomes a transitional culture, and he transfers this culture to his home and family.
He goes and tells them, "Give me this or teach me this."
Training staff or the person who provided this information to the students
How did you select him and how was the communication with the student established? Who initiated the communication?
Yes, there were many parties that helped us, may God reward them well.
We have brothers at the diet center who educate them about food, healthy food of course.
And learn from Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they organize themselves, and how they set their priorities!
To learn cooking, sports, or awareness of the value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, a curriculum, or
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school.
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, gathering all the boys and girls.
These things are not about a specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible, because they are our children.
How to deal with these students at first!
I initially said that the results were satisfactory.
Is it enough to have three terms or specific terms in those schools?
Now, when you start an experiment in the world, it doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts within a reasonable range that encompasses all the attributes; sons, daughters, independent, and private.
Because it is not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, such as their acceptance of things for their children and their non-acceptance of
They basically want to participate in it, and to be honest, it's very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the appropriate period for him to know about his health.
This is a struggle for many people who want to lose weight, but they feel it's impossible.
Some actors we've seen in the movies with thin bodies say this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of that.
And fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits and vegetables.
So the person needs to know the benefits of fruits and understand that if they eat them, their health will improve, which will boost their morale.
As for fruits, they went to the supermarket and chose their fruits.
So this is a point.
It is diverse and of course they compete, each school was creative with the different ideas of its teachers.
Spirit of competition
We provide them with guidelines and everyone must be creative.
Did the teachers train the students, or do you have a special team?
We trained them, we trained them.
But the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would dedicate Saturday to students' activities.
This is a day outside school hours, they decide and adopt it, Rokia's teacher said she will hold a procession.
They said they would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the boys to cook healthily for themselves, the girlsployployployployploy
Also, I would like to thank Reyan Water for providing all the water free of charge to schools, Reyan Water in this regard.
Of course, water is much healthier because it is needed to cleanse his body of all the toxic substances that enter his body daily through water.
We said the third week.
It means his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and doesn't know that this is the game I love.
Right, right, exactly, and some might want another game, they might not like team games.
Welcome with us live.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and manager of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association, welcomes us.
Of course, we try as much as possible to focus on important topics.
We would like to introduce and explain to our dear viewers what multiple sclerosis is.
Because this name might be unfamiliar to us as well,
The number of women was greater than the number of men in this.
All available treatments now are preventive treatments.
The white cells that are supposed to protect us start to
He kills us by hitting the nerve cell.
Make it easier for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, let's say it's a nylon layer.
Of course, it usually leads to dizziness and double vision, diplopia.
It also led to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In the worst case, it leads to madness, tetraplegia or paraplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions in the body will be severely damaged.
Or from this disease, a condition called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories suggest that it was transmitted through a virus.
The disease is not epidemic.
What is transmitted to children.
Some people consider it a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for example, was excluded from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease currently has no treatment because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have been unable to find the cause of the disease, which prevents them from finding a treatment.
Currently, the process is now reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this issue, which we can say is that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a particular group, a group that you feel this disease is spreading especially among?
Internationally, it was ranked between the top 20 and 40.
Currently, the international community for the same disease has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it started attracting young people up to the age of forty.
Nevertheless, humans do not heal from it.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the community, Multiple Sclerosis Society Qatar.
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so I thought about forming an association for this subject.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, they say there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred to three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five to six years ago
My number was sixty-four and six.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is actually suffering from this disease?
We're not certain it's a virus, so we don't want to commit to a specific theory. That's one point. calendar calendar calendar calendar calendar presenters presenters presenters presenters presenters presenters presenters presenters presenters presenters presenters presenters
The second point is how can I know if I'm suffering from it or not.
This is very difficult.
I am perplexed, Oh Mr. Abdulaziz! I am trying to discover a certain point.
