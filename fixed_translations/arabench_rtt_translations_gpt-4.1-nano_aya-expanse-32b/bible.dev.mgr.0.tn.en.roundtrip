Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
Josiah was the father of Jehoiakim and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go into exile in Babylon.
After this, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Azariah. Azariah was the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akhim. Akhim was the father of Eliud.
Eliezer was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the exile to Babylon. There were fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon until the Messiah. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Yusuf, her husband, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her in front of people. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
As Joseph was pondering these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"He will be called the Son of God. You are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
All this happened in order to fulfill what the Lord had said would come to pass. He said it through the prophet.
The virgin will conceive and give birth to a child. She will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph got up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary to his house as his wife.
But he did not live with her until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
Wise kings visit Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This was during the time when Herod was king over Judea. After Jesus was born, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard the story, he was very angry. Everyone in Jerusalem was disturbed as well.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem. He said to them, "Go! Search carefully for the child. When you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After they had listened to the king's wise men, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east was ahead of them. At last, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their homeland by a different route. Jesus' family fled to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose. In the night, he walked to Egypt with the child and his wife Mary.
They remained until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became very angry. He issued orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All the boys who were two years old or under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He had said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who tried to kill the child are dead."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
Now after they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him.” And he got up, took the child and his mother by night, and fled to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod.
Here he lived in a city called Nazareth. And what the prophets said about Jesus came true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Get away from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one the prophet Isaiah spoke about. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people came out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit that shows you have turned away from your sins.
Don't think that you can say of yourself, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water, to lead you to repentance. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
His scythe is in his hand to clean the chaff from the harvest's threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the chaff with a fire that cannot be quenched." Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why have you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be a temporary story. It is right for us to act this way. She will fulfill the sacred plan of the Lord." Then John agreed.
When Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is being tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness. There the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights without food, Jesus was hungry.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
If you kneel down and worship me, he said, I will give you all this.
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
And suddenly, the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake, in the region of Zebulun and Naphali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said came true. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where people who are not Jews live! Land on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. Those who live in a land of deep darkness—on them a light will shine." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that hour Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent of your sins!" "The kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There, he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
Meanwhile, they left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw another pair of brothers. They were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
Immediately they left their nets and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowd. He went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
And then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Congratulations to you when people laugh at you and hurt you on my behalf. And congratulations to you also when they say all kinds of malicious lies about me.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people harm the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by people.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Also, people don't light a lamp and put it under a plate. Instead, they put it on its stand. Then, it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good works you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives full meaning to the law.
I don't think I've come to change what is written in the Torah or the Prophets. I haven't come to do that. On the contrary, I have come to give full meaning to what is written.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter or stroke of the Torah disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the Torah until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
That's what I'm telling you. You need to be more compassionate than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you're not, you certainly won't enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder
I heard what they told the people who have lived for a long time. They said, "Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be punished for it."
As for Hany, I tell you, don't be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to hellfire.
"Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar and remember that your brother has something against you..."
Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother; then come and present your gift.
Assume someone has a claim against you and is about to sue you. Resolve the issue quickly. Do it while you're with him on the way. If you don't, he might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the officer. And you might get imprisoned.
What I'm about to tell you is true. Don't go out until you've spent your last penny! Adultery
I have heard what they said, "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
This is what I'm telling you. Don't look at a woman in the wrong way. Anyone who does that has already committed adultery in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better for you to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell.
It is written, "If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
As for Hani, I tell you: anyone who divorces his wife makes her commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife if she is unfaithful to him. I swear.
Again, I heard what they said to your people long ago: "Do not break the covenants I have made with you. Keep the oath that you have sworn."
As for Hani, I'll tell you. Don't make too many promises like that. Don't promise in the name of heaven. This is God's throne.
Don't do it in the name of the Earth. This chair is for my feet, my Lord. Don't do it in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head. You cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let 'yes' mean 'yes', and let 'no' mean 'no'. Anything more than that is from the devil. Be kind to others.
I have heard what they said: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
"But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."
Suppose someone sues you to steal your shirt. Let him have even your coat.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Walk two miles with him.
Give to anyone who asks you. Do not refuse those who borrow from you. Love your enemies.
I heard what they said, "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
As for Hani, I'll tell you. Love your enemy. Pray for those who harm you.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. "He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you greet your people with peace, what more do you do than others? Even people without religion do the same.
A perfect kingdom, just like your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing 'righteous deeds' in front of people. Don't do them so that people can see you. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
"When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full."
When you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Therefore, your giving shall be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in private. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that people may see them. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
To pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Lord, who cannot be seen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what happens in secret.
When you pray, don't talk too much like those who don't fear God. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need before you ask him.
"This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.'
May your kingdom come. May what you love be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Protect us from sinning when we are at ease. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people who wrong you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if you do not forgive people their sins, neither will your Father forgive you your sins. Fasting
How can you fast without eating, yet not put on a gloomy face like those who pretend to be holy? They darken their faces with much frowning. They love to show people that they are fasting. What I am telling you is true. They receive their reward in full.
But to walk without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Some people don't know that you are fasting. It is your Father, who cannot be seen, who knows. He is the one who gives the reward. Your Father sees what is done in secret. He stores up treasures in heaven.
Do not let wealth linger in your hands in this world. Moths and rust can corrupt them. Thieves can steal them and break in.
Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your money is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. Suppose your eyes are beautiful. Then your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eyes are weak, then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other. He cannot be faithful to one and hate the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
"I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
Look at the birds in the sky. They don't sow or reap in the fields. They don't gather crops into barns. Yet your Father in heaven provides for them. Aren't you worth much more than they are?
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
And why worry about clothing? Look how the wild flowers grow. They neither work nor spin.
As for Hani, I'll tell you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
If God dresses the wild grass, won't He clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today only to be thrown into the fire tomorrow. Your faith is very small!
Don't worry. Don't say, "What are we going to eat?" or "What are we going to drink?" or "What are we going to wear?"
People without religion run after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows what you need.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Every day has its own troubles.
Be fair when you judge others.
Don't judge others. Then you won't be judged.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
You're only seeing a bit of wood dust in your friend's eye. But you're not noticing the log in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend, "Let me get that wood splinter out of your eye"? And how do you say it when you've got a piece of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the log from your own eye. Then you will see clearly and remove the speck from your neighbor's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and you shall be given. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and the door shall be opened unto you.
Everyone who asks receives an answer. He who seeks finds. The door opens for him who knocks.
Suppose your son asked for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?
You shouldn't ask for a whale. Who among you would give him a snake?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, treat others as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk on this road.
But the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
"You can tell the true ones by what they do. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes? Do they gather figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
"Lord, Lord," they will say to me on that day, "Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and perform many miracles in your name?"
And then we say clearly, 'I never knew you. Stay away from me, you evildoers!' The wise and foolish builders.
So, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain is falling. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and striking that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
But whoever hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain is falling. The water is rising. The winds are blowing and hitting that house. And they are making a loud and gentle sound.
Jesus went on to say all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Teach like someone with authority. Don't speak like a religious teacher.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, fell on his knees, and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this. Be cleansed!" Immediately, the man was healed of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The centurion went away in faith.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for help.
"Oh my Lord," he said, "my servant is sick in the house and cannot move. He is suffering a great deal."
Jesus said, "Let us go and heal him."
The leader replied, "My lord, I cannot come to your house. But say a word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
We tell you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven, and sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
As for those who think that those who belong to the kingdom will be cast out, in the darkness. That's where they'll cry and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus heals many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife. She was lying in bed, sick with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
When evening came, they brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. He placed his hands on each one and healed them.
By doing this, he fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He carried our sufferings and bore our pains. We thought he was punished, struck by God, and humbled. But he was pierced for our rebellions, crushed for our faults. He bore the punishment that makes us whole, and by his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4-5) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the large crowd around him. So he gave orders to his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then came a teacher from the law to him and said, "Teacher, we will follow you wherever you go, wherever you go."
Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another follower said to him, "Lord, let me go and bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm came upon the lake. The waves beat against the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Oh Lord! Save us! We are drowning!"
He answered them, "How little faith you have! Why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gerasenes. He encountered two men possessed by demons, who came out from the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they shouted. "Have you come to punish us before the time of our judgment?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The devil begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea and drowned.
Those who had been raising pigs fled. They went to the countryside and reported all this. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by demons.
Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus went to the other side. He walked to the other side of the lake and returned to his own country.
Some men brought him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. He said to the man, "Do not be afraid, my child; your sins are forgiven."
Some teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Than to say, "Rise and walk"?
"I tell you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and walked home.
When they saw this group, they were amazed. They praised God for giving men such authority. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked Jesus' disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well don't need a doctor. It's the sick who do."
"Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day, John's disciples came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why don't your disciples fast?"
Isa answered, "How can the groom's guests be sad when he is with them? The time will come when the groom will leave them. Then they will fast."
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will only pull away from the old one. That way, the tear will only get worse.
People don't pour new wine into old skins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new skins. Then, everything is preserved. A dead daughter and a weary woman.
As Jesus was saying this, a ruler came up, knelt down before him, and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live again."
Jesus rose and walked with him. And his disciples increased.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
She thought, "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I'll be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the governor's palace, he saw the flute players present. And he saw the troublesome crowd.
He said, "Go away. The girl didn't die. She's just sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the people had gone, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over the region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "Go, your faith will guide you."
They could see each other again. Jesus warned them sternly, "Make sure no one knows about this."
They had already left and spread the news. They talked about it all over that area.
As they were going out, they brought a demon-possessed man to Jesus. The demon made him unable to speak.
To cast out the devil, the man spoke. The audience was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has happened in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." And a certain scribe answered and said, "Teacher, you have well said."
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every infirmity.
When he saw the crowd, he felt a deep sense of compassion. They were defeated and had no strength, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his field.
Jesus sends out the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
The names of the twelve apostles are: Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, followed by James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Next in order are Philip and Bartholomew, then Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector. Two more are added, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Don't go among the Gentiles," he said. "Don't enter any Samaritan town."
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those with skin diseases. Cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Take no gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. The worker must be given what he needs.
When you enter any town or village, look for someone who welcomes you. Stay in this person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet the people who live there.
If this house welcomes you, give it a blessing of peace. If it doesn't, don't give it a blessing.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust from your feet as you leave the house or town.
What I'm about to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for this city.
I am sending you like sheep among wolves. So be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware! The men are going to hand you over to the local courts. They are going to whip you in their temples.
So that judges and kings may come to me, to see me, the non-Jews, as witnesses against them.
But if they're going to arrest you, don't worry about what you're going to say or how you're going to say it. At that point, they'll give you the right words to say.
You will be the one to speak. May your father's spirit speak through you.
Brothers handing over their brothers to be killed. Fathers handing over their children. Children rising up against their parents and leaving them to be killed.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I'm telling you is true. You will not finish traveling among the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is no better than his teacher. A slave is no better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebub, what can the others who live there expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemies. Everything hidden will be revealed. Everything concealed will be uncovered.
What is whispered to you in the dark, proclaim in the daylight. What is shouted in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
You can't buy two sparrows for just one penny. But don't let your father find out if one of them falls to the ground.
So that every hair on your head is counted!
Don't be afraid. You are worth much more than many birds.
What do you think of someone who says in front of people who know me? I also say in front of my Father in heaven whom I know.
As for what you think about someone who says in front of people that they don't know me? I'll say in front of my father in heaven that I don't know him.
I don't think I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword.
Boys against their parents. Girls refusing to obey their mothers. Mothers-in-law against their mothers-in-law.
A man's foes are they of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their child more than me doesn't deserve me.
"Anyone who does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If someone loses their life, they will waste it. If someone wastes their life because of me, they will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Assume that someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That is how you receive the reward of the prophet. And assume that someone welcomes a religious person as a religious person. That is how you receive the reward of the religious person.
Suppose someone were to give even a cup of cold water to one of my little ones. I tell you, they will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus completed the instruction of his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus replied, "Go back to John and tell him what you hear and see."
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised up. And the good news is preached to the poor.
God bless those who don't lose hope in their faith because of me.
When John's disciples had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
And what did you see when you went out? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
That's what is written in the Holy Book. It says, "I will send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare your way for you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and forceful people are seizing it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is the one who was supposed to come to me.
He who has ears, let him hear.
What can we compare today's people to? They are like children sitting in the markets and calling out to others. They say,
We played the trumpet for you. But you didn't dance. We sang you a funeral song. But you didn't mourn.
When John came, he didn't eat or drink like you. And people said, 'He has a demon.'
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Look at this man, he eats too much and drinks too much. He associates with tax collectors and 'sinners.' Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right." Cities do not repent of sin.
Jesus began to speak about the cities where he had performed most of his miracles. The people there did not repent of their sins. So he said,
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
As for me, I tell you this: On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom that were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
"As for me, I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." "Rest for all who are weary."
At that time Jesus said, "We praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what you asked for.
Father gave me everything. Father is the only one who knows the son. Those who know the Father are other than the son and those whom the son chooses to know him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Follow my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and not arrogant. You will find comfort for your souls.
Serving me is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through fields of grain. His disciples were hungry, so they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
He entered the House of the Lord. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which only priests were allowed to consume.
Haven't you read the law? It says how every Sabbath the priests in the temple must perform their service on that day. Yet they are not considered guilty.
We tell you what is more important than the temple is here.
The book says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you wouldn't sue innocent people.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
From there, Jesus went to their temple.
A man with a withered hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is more valuable than sheep! That's why the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
And afterward Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to say who he was.
This was to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken. He said,
Hani Abdi. I chose him. He's the one we love. I'm very happy with him. I will put my soul into it. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be restored.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
What doesn't break a broken branch. What doesn't quench a flickering flame. So that everything is corrected.
"A bruised reed He will not break, And a dimly burning wick He will not quench; He will faithfully bring forth justice. He will not be disheartened or crushed Until He has established justice on the earth; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Belaziem
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out devils, he is fighting against himself. How can his kingdom stand?
"They say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But if I cast out demons, by whom do your people cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges."
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think about this. How do you enter the house of a strong man and take what he owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can steal his house.
Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
Hani, I tell you what. Every sin and every evil word spoken against the Lord will be forgiven. But blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whatever blasphemy is spoken against the Son of Man will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O den of venomous snakes! How can you evil doers say anything good? Your mouths reveal what is in your hearts.
A good man speaks good words. These words come from the good that is hidden within him. An evil man speaks evil words. These words come from the evil that is hidden within him.
As for Hani, I will tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every wrong word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be condemned or acquitted." - The miraculous mark of Greece.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
"Wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment day with the people who are living now. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh repented from their sins, just as Noah called them to. And now, one greater than Noah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the people who are now living. And she will prove them guilty. She came from far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a man? It wanders through dry places, searching for a place to rest. But it finds none.
And then he says, 'I'll go back to the house I left.' When he arrives, he finds the house empty. The house was clean and tidy.
"And after the unclean spirit has gone out, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order. Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first." - Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are waiting outside. They'd like to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus indicated to his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
Whichever one does what my father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd of people gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things through stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed."
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. The birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
By the time the sun came up, it had burned the plants. Many of them withered because they had no roots.
The rest of the seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop a hundred, sixty or thirty times more than what was sown.
He who has ears, let him hear.
The pupils asked him. They said, "Why do you use stories when you speak to people?"
"I gave you the chance to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. I didn't give it to strangers."
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have abundant knowledge. But those who do not have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away from them.
We use stories to communicate with people, saying: "They see, but they don't really see. They hear, but they don't really hear or understand."
These words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled in you: "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; you will indeed see, but you will not perceive."
"The hearts of these people have become dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing. They have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, and He would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
Blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
What I am going to tell you is true. Many prophets and servants of God wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but don't understand it. Then the devil comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like seeds planted on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they last only a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the seed, preventing it from bearing fruit.
"Others, however, received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted." The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man planted good seed in his field."
While he was sleeping, his enemy came. He planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said, "Sir, didn't you sow good grain in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
"An enemy did this," he answered. The servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and cut the grass?"
"No," replied the owner. "When you uproot the weeds, you might uproot the wheat with them."
Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. That's what I'm telling them. First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then, gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn. "The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field."
He is the smallest of them all, your seed. But to grow, it becomes the largest plant in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus told all these stories to the crowds using parables. He didn't say anything to them without telling a story.
The words spoken by the prophet have come to pass. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things from the time of creation." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went home. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
Answer, "He who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds represent people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the workers are the angels.
Hashish is withdrawn and burned in the fire. That's how the Day of Judgment will be.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
And let the people of God shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear. Tales of hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When one man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. He went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that was very expensive. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought this coral. The story of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
This is how the Day of Reckoning will be. The angels will come to distinguish between those who did wrong and those who did right.
So that the evil people can be thrown into the blazing oven. Then the evil ones will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Isa continued telling these stories. Then he left right away.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to preach to the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did he get all these things from?
They were not happy with him at all. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not honored in his own country. He does not receive honor in his own home."
They did many miracles, but they didn't believe.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was saying to Herod, "It is against the law for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John, but he feared the people, for they regarded him as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. He was delighted.
He promised her on his right hand that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he thought about his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
They brought his head on a large platter and gave it to the girl. Then she carried it.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went by boat to a secluded place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them and was concerned for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "The hour is late. Send the multitude away so that they may go into the villages and buy food."
Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves and two fish," they answered.
Bring them here to me, he said.
And afterward, Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments that were left.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Jesus had the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, while he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The cruiser was far from the shore. It was taking heavy waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus went out to his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. They said, "It's a ghost!" and screamed in fear.
All along, Jesus called out to them, "Be brave! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, is it you?" Peter asked. "If it is, tell me to come to you on the water."
Come, said Jesus. So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they got into the boat, the wind died down.
And those in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed in Gennesaret.
The men who lived there had known Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding districts. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to let the sick people touch the edge of his clothes, and everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and some scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus replied, "Why don't you obey the command of my Lord? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
Don't you allow people to say to their parents, 'Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God.'
They do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make God's word of no value in order to follow your own teachings.
Oh, hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are distant from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him. He said to them, "Hear and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not make you unclean. It is what comes out of your mouth that makes you unclean.
Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
Don't you understand yet? Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
What comes out of the mouth is from the heart. That's what makes you 'impure'.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. This includes murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. Also theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you 'impure'. But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you 'impure'. "A woman's faith is from Canaan."
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Once there was a Canaanite woman living near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon is tormenting my daughter. She suffers greatly."
Jesus did not say a word. So his disciples came to him. They asked him, "Send her away. She is always shouting at us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
And then the woman fell to her knees in front of him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
He said, "They shouldn't take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Oh, my God," she said. "Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing the blind and the lame, the paralyzed and those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. The blind could see. And the people praised the Lord of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "Where will we find enough bread to feed this great crowd?" They said, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish."
"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they said, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
Take the seven loaves and the fish and give thanks. Then break them and distribute them to the disciples. And the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward, the disciples gathered seven baskets of leftovers.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had called the crowd to him, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign of a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign or miracle from heaven.
Answer, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'"
In the morning she says, 'Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' She knows the meaning of what she sees in the sky. But she can't understand the signs of what's happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to take the bread.
"Beware," Jesus told them. "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked about it among themselves. They said, "He must be saying that because we didn't bring him bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said, "Your faith is very small. Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? How many baskets full of pieces did you gather?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces were collected?
How is it that you don't understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven in the bread. He was warning them about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"And you?" he asked. "Who are you saying I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven."
You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ. Jesus spoke of his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He said to them, "I must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. I must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
Peter turned to Jesus and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to follow me must deny themselves. They must take up their cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What's the point if someone wins the whole world but loses their soul? What can they trade for their soul?
The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
What I am going to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus' appearance changes.
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, the brother of James. He led them up a high mountain, where they were alone.
Before them, his form changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the pupils heard this, they were very afraid. They fell face down to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Arise, do not be afraid."
By the time they turned around, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone until you see him," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do our religious teachers say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "Truly. Elijah is supposed to come and restore all things again."
But I tell you, Elias has come already, and they did not recognize him. They did to him whatever they wanted to do. So also will they do to the Son of Man.
And then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy with a demon.
As he came near the crowd, a man ran up to Jesus, knelt down before him,
Oh my Lord, he said, have mercy on my son. He trembles a lot and suffers a lot. He always falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought it for your students, but they couldn't see it.
"You brood of vipers! How long shall I remain with you? How long shall I bear with you?" said Jesus. "Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
And afterward, the disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
"You answered, 'Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.'"

They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise again." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, it does," he said. As Peter entered the house, Jesus was the one who spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties? From their own children or from others?"
"From those who have been given much, much will be demanded," said Peter. "And from those to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be asked," Jesus replied.
But we don't want to upset them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find the exact change you need inside. Take it and call them to pay my tax and yours.
