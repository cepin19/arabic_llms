environmental khoa-tree of Jesus
khoa is a genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah was the father of Pharez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. Pharez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.
khoa was the father of Aminadab. Aminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
Salmon was Boaz's father. Rahab was Boaz's mother. Boaz was Obed's father. Ruth was Obed's mother. Obed was David's father.
And Jesse was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was the wife of Uriah.
khoaleyman was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram. Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezeki'ah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Joachim the father of Joachim and his brethren were carried away at that time, when the Jews were carried away to Babylon.
Then the family line continued. Joachim was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zephaniah was the father of Obadiah. Obadiah was the father of Jehiel. Jehiel was the father of Azur.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akhim. Akhim was the father of Eliud.
Elieud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the exile to Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon until the Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He did not want to humiliate her in public, so he planned to divorce her secretly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”
She will have a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had said would happen. He had said through the prophet,
The virgin will conceive and bear a son, and his name will be Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14) Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she had borne a son; and he called his name Jesus.
Wise kings visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, the magi came from the east to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, as was everyone in Jerusalem.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the Magi secretly, and learned from them exactly when the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report back to me. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. Finally, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different route. The Holy Family flees to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod will search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph arose during the night, and departed into Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, fulfilling the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
When Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he was furious. He gave orders regarding Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
So Joseph rose and took the child and his mother Mary, and came to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee instead.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. So he believed what the prophets had said about Jesus, that he would be called a Nazarene.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Turn away from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people came out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him for baptism. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit that shows you have turned away from your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe is already at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me comes one who is greater than I, who I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His sickle is in his hand to clean the grain from his harvest. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the chaff with a fire that cannot be quenched." Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
Jesus said, "Let it be so now. It is right for us to do this. She is fulfilling God's holy plan." And John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where the devil tempted him.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' (Deuteronomy 8:3)"
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
If you are the Son of God, he said, throw yourself down. For it is written: "The Lord will command his angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone." (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written: 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
If you kneel down and worship me, he said, I will give you all this.
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! The land along the Mediterranean Sea! The region east of the Jordan River!
"Those who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. I will make you fishers of men.
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and Jesus called them.
Immediately they left their boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. All kinds of sick people were brought to him. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up on the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are those who are rid of pride. They will be given the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. So it was with the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Also, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bushel. They put it on its stand, and it lights up the whole house.
Similarly, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the finest stroke of a pen from the law will disappear until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even the least important commandment, and do not teach others to break it. If you do, you will be called the least important in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
Here is what I tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the scribes. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
I have heard what was said to those who lived long ago. They were told, "You shall not kill." (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be judged for their deed.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of hellfire.
Suppose you are presenting your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar and go first to be reconciled with your brother; then come and present your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do so while you are still with him on the way. If you do not, he may hand it over to the judge. The judge may hand it over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm about to tell you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Adultery
You shall not commit adultery. (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go into hell. Divorce.
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I tell you, anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.
Once again, I have heard what was said to your people long ago: "Do not break the covenant you made with the Lord. Keep the oath you swore to him."
But that's what I'm telling you. Don't make any such promises at all. Don't do it for heaven's sake. That is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of Earth. It is the throne of God's feet. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. It is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let "yes" simply mean "yes." Let "no" mean "no." Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
It has been heard that it was said: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."
Suppose someone sues you to take your shirt. Let him take your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not turn away him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
I have heard it said, "Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and keep your enemy close."
But here's what I say to you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who harm you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. 'He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.'"
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your own people, what are you doing more than others? Even the hypocrites do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of others. Do not do them so that others may see you. If you do, your Father who is in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who pretend to be holy. They proclaim their deeds in the synagogues and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am about to tell you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your giving will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward.
When you pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not keep talking like evil people do. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need before you ask him.
"This is the way you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.'"
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Deliver us from evil.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do that, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if you do not forgive others their offenses, neither will your Father forgive you your offenses. Fasting
When you go without eating, don't pretend to be sad like those who only pretend to be holy. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I'm telling you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then no one will know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who is unseen, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart will be where your treasures are.
The eyes are the lamp of the body. Suppose your eyes are good. Then your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothes? Look at how the wild flowers grow. They don't work, nor do they make clothes.
But that's what I'm telling you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
So don't worry. Don't say, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
Those who do not fear God pursue all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure with which you measure others.
You see a speck of sawdust in your friend's eye, but you pay no attention to the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me remove a splinter from your eye," when there's a speck of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs. Do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will be given. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or what father, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people travel this road.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. Matthew 7:14 (ESV)
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell what they are really like by their actions. "Do people pick grapes from thornbushes? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!" The wise and foolish builders.
So everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain falls. The water rises. The winds blow and strike that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The rain falls. The water rises. The winds blow and strike that house. And it crashes with a loud thunder.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Teach as one with authority. He did not speak as the scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus and knelt down before him, saying, "Lord, if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing." "Be clean!" Immediately, the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer with faith.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"O my Lord," he said, "my servant is resting at home and cannot move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority. I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes. I say to that one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith as great as this."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown out, into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done for you as you have believed." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus heals many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the crowd around him, and he told his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a Pharisee came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm arose on the lake. The waves were breaking over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Lord! Save us! We are about to drown!"
He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The crowds were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two demon-possessed men.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. He was met by two men possessed by demons, who came out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before our time?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned in the water.
Those who tended the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everyone everything, and what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and went to his hometown.
Men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the teachers of the law said to each other, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who couldn't walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed. They praised God for granting such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast. Why do not your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People do not sew a piece of new cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will tear away from the old one. That will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved. A dead girl and a suffering woman.
While Jesus was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up to Jesus from behind. She was suffering from a discharge of blood, which had lasted for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
I thought, "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I'll be cured."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said. "Your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said, "Back off. The girl is not dead. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout that district. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "Your faith has healed you."
They could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over that area.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was unable to speak.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." Only a few workers are there.
Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest field.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Next in order are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
And as you walk, preach, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying; give without being paid.
Do not take any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in that person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If that house welcomes you, give it a blessing of peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves, so be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
They will be brought before judges and kings because of me. They will testify to them and to those who are not Jews.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, the right words will be given to you.
You will not be the speaker. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is the truth. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, what can those who live there expect?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be made known. Everything that is secret will be revealed.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light. What is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law.
"A man's foes shall be they of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
"Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Assume that someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. Then they will receive the reward of a prophet. And assume that someone welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person. Then they will receive the reward of a righteous person.
Suppose someone were to give even a cup of cold water to one of my little ones. I tell you the truth, that person will certainly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he continued teaching and preaching in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus said, "Go back to John and tell him what you hear and see."
Blind people receive their sight. Lame people walk. Lepers are cleansed. Deaf people hear. Dead people are raised to life. And poor people are told the good news.
Blessed are those who do not lose faith in me.
When John's disciples had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go out to see? A man in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
"So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
He is the person mentioned in the Bible. The text says, "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Never has there been born a greater man than John the Baptist. But the least person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than he is.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive him, John is the Elijah who was to come.
Let those with ears listen.
"What can I compare the people of today to? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to others. They say,"
We played you a flute tune, but you didn't dance. We sang you a funeral song, but you didn't mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. People say, "He is possessed by a jinn."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent. He said,
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
"But I tell you this: On the day of judgment it will be more bearable for Sodom than for you." Comfort for the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son chooses to make known to him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my disciples and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through fields of grain. His disciples were hungry, so they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus said, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It explains how the priests in the temple are to perform their duties every Sabbath day. But they are not considered guilty.
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
The writing says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
From there, Jesus entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and distorted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than a sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was completely restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus, seeking to kill him.
Jesus knew of the Pharisees' plots. He left that place, and many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to tell who he is.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said,
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will put my Spirit on him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a bending twig. He won't quench a flickering flame. He'll fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and the swallows.
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and they asked, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your people cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take what he has all by yourself? You must tie him up first. Then you can rob his house.
He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
So I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either now or in the days to come.
If you make the tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make the tree bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O den of venomous snakes! How can evil say anything good? Your tongues reveal what is in your hearts.
A good man speaks good things. They come from the good that is stored within him. An evil man speaks evil things. They come from the evil that is stored within him.
But that's what I'm telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be held accountable for every careless word they've spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." - The Gospel of Matthew 12:37 (English Standard Version)
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge whale for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person? It passes through dry places seeking a place to rest, but finds none.
He then says, "I will return to the house I left." When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirit goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself. They go in and live there, and the man becomes worse than before. So will it be with this evil generation." - Jesus and His Brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
Everyone who does what my father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On that very day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat and sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things by means of stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed."
The seeds were scattered on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Another seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
Those with ears, listen.
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
Anyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have too much. And if anyone does not have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive."
"Their hearts have become callous. They barely hear with their ears, they have closed their eyes; otherwise they would see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, who would then heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message of the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. These are the ones who hear the word and accept it with joy immediately.
But they have no roots. Therefore they endure only for a short time. They fall away quickly from the faith when tribulation or persecution arises because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the word, but the worries of life and the deceitful promises of wealth choke it, preventing it from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the word and understand it. They produce a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another parable. "What the kingdom of heaven is like," he said, "is this: A man sowed good seed in his field."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? How then did weeds come to be growing in it?"
He said, "An enemy did this." He asked the servants, "Do you want to go and pull up the weeds?"
The owner said, "No, while weeding, you might uproot the wheat along with the weeds."
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what they should do. Here is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my barn." The Parable of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds. Yet when it grows, it becomes the largest of the garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast. A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus spoke these things to the multitudes in parables. He didn't tell them anything without a parable.
So the words that the prophet spoke were true. He said, "I will open my mouth and utter parables. I will proclaim hidden things, things from the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus interprets the story of the rods.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went home. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. So will it be at the end of time.
The Son of Man will send His angels. They will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will throw them into the burning furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Whoever has ears, let them hear. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value, went and sold all he had, and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered together every kind of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.
Thus will be the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be cast into the burning furnace. There, the wicked will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. They said, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his town of Nazareth. There he began teaching people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own relatives and in his own home."
He only performed a few miracles there because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to perform miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who had been the wife of Philip, his brother.
John was telling Herod, "It is against the law for you to own it."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. She pleased Herod greatly.
So he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked.
Her mother told her what to say. And the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very disturbed. But he remembered his promise and his dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she requested.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was placed on a large platter and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a secluded place. The crowd heard about it, and they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As the evening drew near, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the time is already late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus said, "There is no need for them to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
Bring them to me, he said.
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the multitude away.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The ship had already traveled a long distance from the shore. It was being tossed about by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they screamed in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, if it is you," Peter asked, "tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They pleaded with him to allow only those who were sick to touch the edge of his clothes. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked him,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).ьюьюьюьюьюь
But you allow people to tell their parents, "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
So they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make God's word of no effect in order to follow your own teachings.
Protesters! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only know human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean"; it is what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean."
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus said, "There are plants that my Father has not planted in heaven. They will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart. These are the things that defile a person.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And so do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She suffers greatly."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
There went Jesus. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountain side and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those unable to speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "What good is that with such a large crowd?"
How many loaves do you have? asked Jesus. They said, Seven, and a few small fish.
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the five loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up seven baskets of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign of a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign, a miracle from heaven.
He replied: "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The pupils crossed over to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus told them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked about this among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said, "Your faith is very small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?"
Haven't you understood yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?
How can you not understand at all? I was not talking to you about bread. Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said, "You are the Christ."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what about you? he asked. Who do you say that I am?
Simon Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
Here is what I say to you. You are Peter. On this rock, I will build my church. And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them that he must go to Jerusalem, where he would suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He would be killed, and on the third day he would rise againwhenwhenwh
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. He said, "Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory, and his angels with him. And then he will reward each one according to his deeds.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus changed.
After six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
There before them his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified. They fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. As they were coming down, Jesus instructed them, saying, "Do not tell anyone what you have seen," and he said, "Wait until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus said, "It is true. Elijah is to come and make all things new again."
But I say to you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt before him.
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He trembles greatly and suffers much. Often he falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your pupils. But they could not cure him.
Oh you faithless and evil people! Jesus answered, "How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring the child to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to leave the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar

They went together to Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be handed over to the hands of men."
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? Do they collect them from their sons or from others?"
"From the others," Peter answered. "Then the sons do not have to pay," Jesus said to him.
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find there the very coin you need. Take it and present it to them as your tribute and taxes.
