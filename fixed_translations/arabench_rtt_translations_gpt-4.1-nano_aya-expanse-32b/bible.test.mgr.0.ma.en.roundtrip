Jesus called a little child to him and had him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Whoever accepts a child like this in my name accepts me.
But what if one of these children who believe in me is led astray? If that happens, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depths of the sea.

Unless your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into the eternal fire of hell with two hands and two feet.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the Kingdom of Heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of Hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
Don't underestimate any of these children. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to visit my father in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep and one of them goes astray. Won't he leave the 99 sheep in the mountain and go look for the one that went astray?
What I'm going to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he will be happier about it than about the 99 that did not get lost.
The same goes for your father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these kids to be lost. When someone makes a mistake like you did
"If your brother has wronged you, go to him. Tell him how he has wronged you. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back."
But what if he won't listen to you? Then take one or two others along with you, for a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I'm going to tell you is true. What is closed to you on earth will be closed to you in heaven. What is open to you on earth will be open to you in heaven.
Again, this is my advice to you. Suppose two of you on earth agree on whatever you ask; my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." The servant who had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked him, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money his subjects owed him.
From the moment the king started managing it, they brought him a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man couldn't pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and everything he owned had to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell on his face before him. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll pay everything back."
Sido felt sorry for him. He forgave him and let him go.
But this servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
The other server fell on his head. "Give me a little time," he asked. "I'll get back to you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the other servants thrown in prison. He will stay there until he can pay what he owes.
The other servants saw what happened. They got very angry. They went and told their master everything that happened.
Then, the master called the first slave. He said to him, "O evil slave, I have forgiven you for everything you owed me because you asked me."
Why didn't you show mercy to the other servant as you showed mercy to me?
In his anger, Mr. Diallo handed him over to the guards. He will be punished until he pays back everything he owes.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had spoken these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the regions of Judea beyond the river Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus said, "Haven't you read that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'?" (Gen 1:27)
He said, 'That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.' (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined.
"Why did Moses command a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus said, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I'm telling you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she has been unfaithful to him.
The students told him, "This is the way it is between a man and a woman; they'd better not get married."
Isa replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who cooperate to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men are unable to bring forth children in the way they were born. Some are made like that by others. Others make themselves like that to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living in that way should do it." Little children are brought to Jesus.
Some people brought their little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
Why are you asking me what is good? Isa answered. There is only one thing that is good. If you want to enter paradise, obey the commandments.
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "'Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not give false testimony.
'Honor your father and your mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
I have kept all these commandments, the young man said. What else do I still have to do?
Jesus answered and said, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
The young man heard this, and he went away sad. It was very expensive.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the travelers heard this, they were greatly astonished. They asked, "Then, who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter replied, "We've lost everything to follow you! What reward will we be given?"
"What I'm about to tell you is true," Jesus said to them. "When everything has been transformed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. And you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left their home, family, or fields because of me will receive a hundred times more. They will gain eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The tale of the workers in the field
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owns a field. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
They agreed to give them a day's wage for their work. Afterwards, he sent them to his farm.
Around nine in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "You too, go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you what is right."
They left. "He went out again at noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing next to each other. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day long doing nothing?"
Where no one had appointed them, they answered. He told them, "Even you, go and work in my vineyard."
"My master came this evening, and spoke to the foreman. He said, 'Call the workers and pay them. Start with those who were hired last, and then finish with the first.'"
The workers who were hired around evening time came. Each one received the usual daily wage.
The ones who came first, expecting more, each received only the regular daily wage.
As soon as they arrived, they started complaining about the landlord.
Those people who were appointed last time only worked for one hour, they said. We gave them the same pay we gave you, even though we did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day.
The owner answered one of them. He said to him, "My friend, I will be fair with you. Won't you agree to work for the regular daily wage?"
Keep your money and go. I wanted to give the ones I hired last time the same wage I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because you've given others free rein?
"Those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last." Jesus keeps guiding us toward his impending death.
Jesus was on his way to Upper Bethsaida. Along the way, he took his twelve disciples aside and stopped with them to speak to them.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
"Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, and spit on him. They will flog him and crucify him. On the third day he will rise again!" The mother asked Jesus for a favor.
The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons. Falling at his feet, she asked him for something.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked. She said, "Promise me that one of my sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise me that the other can sit at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but it is not for me to grant who will sit at my right or left. These places are for those my Father has prepared."
The other nine students heard about this. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said to them, "You know the rulers of the Gentiles, who lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Don't be like that. On the contrary, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as the price to set many people free. Two blind men see.
Jesus and his disciples were going from Jericho. A large crowd followed them.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They were told to be quiet. But the two men shouted even more, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
Sir, answer us, we want to be able to see.
Jesus felt a great deal of concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He told them, "Go to the village ahead of you. When you arrive, you will find a donkey tied up. Her foal will be with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them the Lord needs them. The owner will send them immediately.
This is what happened so that what the prophet spoke about would become reality. He says,
Say to the city of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you. He is righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and its colt. They laid their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large group of people spread out their cloaks on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed. All of them were shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heavens!"
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was cleansing the temple.
Jesus entered the temple. He began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it a den of robbers." (Jeremiah 7:11)
Blind people and those with disabilities came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and heard the kids in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" When they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus. "Haven't you ever read," they retorted, "'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Afterward, Jesus went out from the people and went into the countryside near Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
So early in the morning, Jesus was returning to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the fig tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be thrown into the sea,' it will happen."
"If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray." Jesus' authority is called into question.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. They asked, "By what authority are you doing these things?" and said, "Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered and said, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you where my authority comes from."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?" They argued about it among themselves. "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
But what if we say, 'among men'? We are afraid of people. Everyone believes that John was a prophet.
Jesus answered them, "I do not know." Then he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. The parable of the two sons."
What do you think about this? A man has two sons. He went to the first one and said, "My son, don't work today in the vineyard."
"I'm not going," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then, the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "Yes, sir." But he did not go.
Which of the two sons did what his father wanted? The first one, they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live. And you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed. I saw this. But even they did not turn back from their sins and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
He heard another story. A man had some land where he planted vineyards. He built a wall around it. He dug a hole for pressing the grapes. And he built a watchtower on it. He rented the vineyards to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the harvest time drew near, Sir Laab went to his tenants. He told them to gather his share of the fruit.
But the Kraouans captured Abido. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him.
Afterwards, the man sent others to the tenants. He sent more than the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, I sold my son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the overseer saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will inherit the owner's property one day. Let's kill him, and everything will be ours."
They seized him and drove him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
To whom does the vineyard belong? What will its owner do to these tenants?
"He will burn those wicked people, answer him. Afterward he will prepare the vineyard for other tenants. They will give him his share of the harvest at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what the Scriptures say? 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Here is what I am telling you. The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to those who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken into pieces. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The priests and the prophets heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
They wanted to find a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Jesus told them more parables. He said,
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
I sent my servant to the people I invited for dinner. The servant told them to come, but they refused.
From then on, he sold some of his livestock. He told them, "Tell the invited ones that I have prepared my wedding feast. I have slaughtered my calves and fattened my cattle. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding dinner."
But the people paid no attention. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest were captured by Abdou. He treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed these criminals and burned their city.
And the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come."
Go to the street vendors. Call for dinner anyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the street. They gathered all the people they could find, whether good or bad. Quickly, the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding attire.
Owner, he asked, "How did you get in here without your wedding dress?" The man couldn't find anything to say.
And the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him into the outer darkness. There, men will weep and gnash their teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went away. They made plans to entrap Jesus in His words.
"Why did you send your disciples? You sent the Herodians with them." "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in all honesty. You don't let others tell you what to do or say. You don't care about how important they are."
Tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said to them, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the money people use to pay taxes. He brought him silver coins.
"Whose picture is it? And what are the words?"
"What is Caesar's, give to Caesar. And what is God's, give to God."
"Where did they hear this thing? They were very surprised. They went for it and went far. Marriage when the dead are resurrected."
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people rise from the dead.
The teacher said, "This is what Moses told us. If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children so that the name of his brother may be preserved."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
Now that the dead have stopped, whose wife will she be? All seven of them were married to her.
Jesus answered and said unto them, "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God."
The dead won't stand, they won't get married. Their parents won't give them away in marriage. They'll be like angels in heaven.
What do you think about those who have died? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The greatest commandment.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. Then the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. Now Jesus tested him with a question.
"Professor," he asked, "what is the most important thing in the law?"
Jesus said, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important thing.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"Everything written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." Who is the son of man?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him, "The son of David."
He told them, "Why do you call me 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
Unless David called him 'Mister', how could he be David's son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him a single question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
You have to obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They shift the heavy burdens onto the shoulders of others. But they themselves are not willing to lift even a finger to move them.
Everything they do, they do it so others will see. They wear small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they let the tassels of their coats hang very long.
They like to sit in places of honor at dinners, and they also like to have the most important seats in the temples.
They love it when people greet them in the market. They love it when people call them 'Lord'.
But you shall not be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one Master, and you are all brothers.
Don't call anyone on earth "Father." You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher'. You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Anyone who raises his head will be brought down, and anyone who is brought down will be raised up.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter."
(No
"What sorrows you bring upon yourselves, you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win one person to your faith, and when you have succeeded, you make that person twice as much a child of hell as you are."
"What is this wonder that you, blind guides, are saying? 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.'"
You are blind and stupid! What's more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that sanctifies the gold?
As you say, "If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift on the altar, he is bound by his oath."
O you blind ones! What is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that sanctifies the gift?
For whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and Him who sits upon it.
"What misery is this you have brought upon yourselves, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former."
You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
What misery is this you have brought upon yourselves, you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
O you Pharisee blind! First cleanse the inside of the cup and the plate, so the outside also will be clean.
Alas, you teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You look clean outwardly, but inside you are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
The same with you. From the outside, it appears that you're doing what's right. But inside, you're filled with what's wrong. You pretend to be something you're not.
"What misery is this you have brought upon yourselves, you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous."
As you say, 'If we had lived in the times of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have aided in the killing of the prophets.'
Now you are testifying against yourself. You admit that you are from the offspring of those who killed the prophets.
Sally on the sins that those before you have begun!
O nest of poisonous wasps! How will you escape being sentenced to fire?
Now I am sending you prophets, sages, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. And in your temples, you will beat others with whips. You will chase them from city to city.
"That you may take away the blood of all the children of God, from among them, from the least to the greatest, from the blood of Abel the Godly to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I'm about to tell you is true. All of this is going to happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
Look, your house is still empty.
As I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus came out of the temple. As he was walking, his disciples came up to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all this?" Jesus asked. "I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left standing on another. Every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There the disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Stay awake! Beware lest anyone deceive you."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many people.
You will hear about wars. You will hear people talking about future wars. Don't be afraid. These things have to happen. But the end is not yet here.
Nations will fight against nations. Kingdoms will fight against kingdoms. People will be hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of the pains of childbirth.
From now on, people are going to hand you over to be treated cruelly and killed. All nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will lead many people astray.
Where evil is growing, a lot of people's love is going to cool down.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, as a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
Prophet David spoke of the "abominable desolation" (Psalm 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader needs to understand this.
So those in Judaism should flee to the mountain.
No one even bothered to come inside to get something.
No one in the field went back to get their coat.
How difficult it must be for pregnant lactating women these days! How difficult it must be for nursing mothers!
Pray so that you don't have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be great torment in these days. It will be worse than anything else from the beginning of the world until now. And there will be nothing like it afterward.
Except for time, nothing is cut short. No one will survive. But because of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that time someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Messiah!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will show great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen ones of God if they can.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "He's far out in the desert," don't go there. Or if they say, "He's inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures will gather where there's a dead body.
After the terrible suffering of these days, "the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. He will gather His chosen people from the four corners of the earth. He will bring them from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. Wherever you see its branches budding and leaves sprouting, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all this happening, you know that the end is near. It's right around the corner.
What I'm about to tell you is true. The people who were living in that time period won't die until all these things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other will be left.
Two women are grinding grain with a hand mill. One will be taken and the other will remain.
Keep your eyes open. You don't know when your Lord will come.
You need to understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew the time of night the thief would come. Afterwards, he would be watching. He wouldn't let his house be robbed.
You also must be ready. For the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose Mr. K gives one of his servants responsibility over the rest of the slaves in his house. The servant's job is to give them their food at the right time. Mr. K wants a faithful and wise servant for this task.
It would be good for the servant if he found him doing his work when the master returns.
What I'm about to tell you is true. The master will give this servant responsibility over everything he has.
But let's assume that the slave is evil. Let's assume he says to himself, "My master is absent a lot of the time."
Suppose he started beating the other servants. And suppose he ate and drank with those who drank a lot.
The master of the servant will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
From now on, Mr. Gadi will be cut into pieces. He will be sent to the place where the claimants go. There, people will cry and gnash their teeth.
The Tale of the Ten Brides
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.
The ignorant people lit their lamps, but they didn't bring olive oil with them.
The wise took the oil in their flasks with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. As a result, all the brides got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted, "Here comes the groom! Come out to meet him!"
Then all the virgins woke up and took their lamps.
The ignorant said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going to go out."
"No," they replied. "It might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil seller. Buy one for yourselves."
They were about to buy oil. But as they were going, the groom arrived. The girls who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was shut.
Afterwards, they brought the other brides too. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he answered, "What I am going to tell you is true. I don't know you."
Stay vigilant. You don't know the day or the hour the groom will come. The story of three slaves.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. He gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew they could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The waiter who got a $10,000 tip walked right out and invested his money. He made another $10,000.
He who won $4,000 increased his winnings by another $4,000.
But the man who took $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these slaves returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who was trusted with $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said to him, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
Sido replied, "You served well, O righteous and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy in a few things. I will give you responsibility over many things. Come and share in your master's joy!"
The man who had $4000 also came. "Sir," he said, "you trusted me with $4000. Look, I've made another $4000."
Sido replied, "You served well, O righteous and trustworthy servant! You were trustworthy in a little, I will appoint you over much. Come and share in your master's joy!"
Then came the man who had taken the $2000. He said to him, "Sir, I know that you are a hard man. You reap where you did not sow and gather grain where you did not scatter seed.
Now I'm scared. I left and hid your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is what belongs to you.
Sido replied, "O servant of evil, lazy one! Do you know that I reap when I haven't sown? Do you know that I gather grains when I haven't scattered seeds?"
Well, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I return, I'll retrieve it with interest.
From then on, his master ordered the other servants, "Take $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000."
Everyone will be given more. They will have more than enough. And what about those who have nothing? Even those who have will have it taken away from them.
Throw this worthless wretch out. In the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth. 'Sheep and goats'
The Son of Man is going to come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven.
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
And then, the king will speak to those on his right, saying to them: "My fathers, bless you. Come and take what is yours. This is the kingdom prepared for you before the world was created."
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes, and you gave them to me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink..."
When did we see you a stranger and invite you? When did we see you in need of clothes and give you some?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and not visited you?
The king is going to answer, "What I am going to tell you is true. Anything you have done to one of these brothers of mine who have no value, you have done it to me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are accursed! Depart from me, you evildoers, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But she didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But she didn't give me anything to drink.
You were strange. But you didn't invite me in. I needed clothes. But you didn't give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you didn't take care of me.
"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
He will answer you, "What I'm going to tell you is true. Anything you haven't done for any of these people who are worthless, you haven't done it for me."
After that, they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who did the right thing will gain eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus said all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is coming soon. The Son of Man is going to be handed over to be crucified.
And afterward the chief priests met with the elders of the people, and they gathered together in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
The chief priests plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "The people may riot." A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was seated at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold for a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this. He said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
The poor will always be with you, but I will not always be.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I'm about to tell you is true. What she did will be said anywhere this joyful news is heard around the world. It will be said in her memory. "Judas agrees to hand over Jesus."
One of the twelve went to the priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
"What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
Answer her, "I am going to the city to find a man. Tell him, 'The teacher said, "My time is near. I will celebrate Passover in your house with my disciples."'"
Now the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; they prepared the Passover.
In the evening, Jesus was sitting with the twelve.
"From among those who eat with me, I tell you: What I am about to say is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."
The students were very sad. One after another, they started to say to him, "It wasn't me, Lord, what is this?"
Jesus said, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish will betray me."
The Son of Man will go as it is written about him. But how much suffering will there be for the one who hands over the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
Judas is the one who will hand him over. He said to him, "It isn't me, Teacher, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is."
From me they used to eat, Jesus took the bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He gave it to his disciples and said to them, "Take this and eat. This is my body."
After that, he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them. He said, "All of you drink from it."
This is my new covenant. It pours out so as to forgive the sins of many people.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I'm not going to drink alcohol with you until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "You will deny me."
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away from me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after we rise from the dead, we will go ahead of you to Galilee.
Peter replied, "Everyone else may leave because of you. But I will never leave."
What I'm going to tell you is true, Jesus answered. It will happen this very night. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.
But Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never say I don't know you." And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and troubled.
And then he said to them, "My spirit is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He walked a few steps forward. Then he fell face-first to the ground. He prayed, "O Father, if it be possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet not my will, but yours be done."
He returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
See, I am ready to pray. After overcoming sin, when temptation is alluring. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again. He prayed, "Father, if this cup can be taken away from me, but if it must be, your will be done."
He came back again. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
He left them and walked away again. For the third time, he prayed the same thing.
He returned to his disciples and said to them, "Are you sleeping and resting now? Look! The hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Come on! Let's go! I'm going to be handed over to them! 'Jesus is arrested.'"
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, arranged a signal with them. "The one I will kiss is the man," he said. "Seize him."
Now Judas went directly to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men moved forward. They seized him and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions went to his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll send an army of over 70,000 angels right away.
But how will the scriptures be fulfilled? They say they must be like this.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. He said, "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" He asked, "Do you need to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day I was sitting in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not long after, Peter followed Jesus. He went straight to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false evidence against Jesus in order to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses came.
They said, "That man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
And then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes. It is just as he said," Jesus replied. "But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
And afterward the high priest rent his garments, saying, "He hath spoken blasphemy! What further need have we of witnesses? Ye have heard his blasphemy."
"What's your opinion?" "He should die!" they answered.
And then they slapped him in the face. They punched him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said, "I don't know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. "You were also with Jesus of Galilee," she said to him.
But before them all, Peter said, "I don't know what you are saying."
He walked out to the door that led to the square. There, one of the women saw him. She told the people, "That man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said he didn't do it. He swore, saying, "I don't know this man!"
A little later, the men standing over there went to Peter. They said to him, "You must be one of them," because his way of speaking gave him away.
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Afterward, Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times," Jesus had told him. Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hanged himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt ashamed and deeply regretted his actions. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I suffered," he said. "I handed over a walking man, a sinner. What does it matter to us? they answered. "That's your problem."
Now Judas threw the money down in the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests collected the money. They said, "It is against the law to put this money into the temple treasury. This is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a pottery field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
And afterward, the word that the prophet Jeremiah had spoken was fulfilled. He said, "They paid thirty pieces of silver, the price set by the people of Israel."
"They paid him thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said to me, 'Throw it to the potter'—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whoever they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
The crowd gathered, and Pilate asked them, "Who do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was the reason they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message. She said to him, "Don't have anything to do with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered greatly in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which of this pair do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"So what should I do with Jesus, called the Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What crime have they committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Belat saw that he wasn't going anywhere. On the contrary, the crowd began to get angry. Now, he took out the water and washed his hands in front of them. He said, "I have nothing to do with this man's death." "You are responsible for this!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but had Jesus scourged. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They put his clothes on him and dressed him in a purple robe.
And after that, they wove thorns together and made a crown, and put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They are watching him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a Cyrenean named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
They crucified me and divided my garments among them, casting lots.
They sat and kept watching him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "You say, 'In three days I will demolish this temple and rebuild it.' Then save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, teachers of the law and elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others," but "He cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
Believe in God. Let God save him now if He wants to. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole country was covered in darkness.
Around three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there said, "We heard Jesus calling out." They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the temple curtain was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The stones were scattered.
The tombs were broken open. Many of the saints who had died came back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and cried out, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also present. So was the mother of Zebed's sons. Jesus was buried.
As the evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea came. His name was Joseph, and he was a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
Put it in his new grave that he dug out of the rock. Roll a large stone in front of the grave's door. Then he went far away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The day after was the day following the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir, they said, "We remembered something the liar said while he was still alive. He said, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
Give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go there and steal the body, and then tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.
"You have a guard," said Pilate. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
They went and made the grave secure. They sealed it and appointed guards to watch over it.
Jesus rose from the dead.
The day of rest is now over. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tombs. He turned over the stone and sat on it.
His body was shining like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they trembled and became like statues.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
He's not here! As he said, he's gone to do it! Come and see the place where he was.
Quickly! Tell his disciples, "He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him." Now you know.
The moments passed quickly from the grave. They were afraid, but they were very happy. They ran to tell the students.
Suddenly, Jesus met them. He said to them, "Peace!" They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
Mina had been their way, some guards went to the city. They informed the high priests of everything that had happened.
The chief priests met with the elders and devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night, stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
Once the governor hears this report, we'll pay him off. This will protect you from trouble.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story spread widely among the Jews to this day. The final orders of Jesus to his disciples.
Afterward, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
As soon as they saw him, they worshiped him. Yet some of them still harbored doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
You shall go and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, to the end.
John the Baptist is preparing the way.
Here is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He spoke to the people in the desert, urging them to repent and start anew, turning away from their sins. And then God would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. Even all the people from Jerusalem went out. After they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothing made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John used to call him. "After me, there comes one who is stronger than I. It is not enough that I fall and untie his sandals."
"I will baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus was baptized and tempted.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens torn open. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice boomed from the sky. It said to him, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very proud of you."
Immediately the Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.
The temptation in the desert lasted 40 days. The devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels attended to him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After they had put John in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the good news of God.
"The time is fulfilled," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. He met there with Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately, they vacated their room and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. From there he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were in a boat mending their nets.
Immediately he called them. And he left his father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and he went after Jesus. And Jesus cast out a spirit that was mute.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When it was the Sabbath, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as one with authority. He did not speak like the scribes of the law.
Suddenly, a man in their synagogue shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Get out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
All the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with such authority! Even the evil spirits obey him and submit to him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They went directly with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simeon's mother was lying in bed. She had a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He walked to her. He grabbed her hand and helped her stand up. The fever left her. Then she started serving them.
In the evening, after sunset, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus. They also brought to Him all who were demon-possessed.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. And he cast out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still very early in the morning, and it was dark. Jesus got up and went out of the house. He went to a place where He could be alone. There He prayed.
Simon and his companions went to look for Jesus.
"They found me, they called out, 'Everyone is looking for you!'"
Isa replied, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the neighboring towns. I need to inform there as well. That's the reason I came."
He went throughout every region of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues. He also cast out demons. Jesus healed a man with a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees he begged Jesus, saying, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do it." The man said, "Be clean!"
Immediately, the disease left him. He recovered.
Send Jesus immediately. Give him a strong warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices required by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and began to talk freely. He spread the news to everyone. So Jesus could not enter the city publicly. He remained outside in desolate places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who couldn't walk.
A few days later, Jesus went back to Capernaum, and the news spread that he was at home.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no longer any room, not even outside the door. And Jesus was teaching them the word.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered him on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law professors were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew what they were thinking in their hearts. He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "I have forgiven your sins"? Or to say, "Get up, take your mat and go"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man,
We're telling you, he said, "Get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he went away, while all the people watched. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus called Levi.
Once again, Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd gathered around him, and he began to teach them.
As he walked along, Jesus saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he said to him. Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.
From then on, Jesus was often dining at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" ate with him and his disciples; they were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
Some of the Pharisees who were teachers of the law were there. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors, and they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." They asked him, "Why do the disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast often and pray. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast often and pray. But yours do not. Why don't they fast?"
Isa answered and said, "How can the bridegroom's companions fast while he is with them? The wedding party cannot fast while they are with the bridegroom."
But the time will come when the groom will be taken from them. On that day, they will leave without eating.
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If you do, the new piece will tear away from the old one. This will only make the tear worse.
"People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One day, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pick and eat some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is against the law on the Sabbath."
Answer, "Have you ever read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
At that time, Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread, which was only permitted for the priests to eat. David also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Therefore the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Again, Jesus went to the synagogue. There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the withered hand. He said to him, "Stand up before everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or destroy one?" But they did not answer.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very upset because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy him. The crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to find a small boat. This would keep people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. So those who were sick pushed to touch him.
The people with evil spirits in them fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them to tell no one who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve disciples.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They had authority to cast out demons.
Why did Jesus appoint the twelve? Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John were called by Jesus the Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
They were even Andrew, Philip, Peter, Matthew, Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus. They were Thaddeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Belzebub.
Jesus entered a house. Again, a large crowd gathered. They were so numerous that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They took responsibility for him. They said, "He's insane."
Some of the scribes of the Law were there. They had come down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he casts out demons."
Now Jesus said to them, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
A kingdom that fights itself cannot stand.
Unless the family is united, it cannot endure.
