There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the exile to Babylon. There were fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon until the Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband Youssef was a religious man. He didn't want to expose her in front of people. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was pondering these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
He will bring forth a son. You shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All these things happened so that what the Lord had said would come true. He had spoken through the prophet,
The virgin will conceive and bear a son. She will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph awoke and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
But what happened with her until she gave birth to a son for him. And he named him Yusuf Isa.
Wise kings Caesar Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This was during the time when Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus was born, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
Solo, "Where is the child who is born to be the King of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was very angry. The people of Jerusalem were also disturbed.
Now Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "That is what the prophet has written. He said,
But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. (Micah 5:2)
From then on, Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He will send them to Bethlehem. He told them, "Go! Search carefully for the child. Whoever finds him, bring me a report. Afterward, I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had heard the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east was ahead of them. At last, it stopped over the place where the child was.
From the moment they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different route. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and fled to Egypt. There he stayed until Herod's death. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
Joseph got up during the night, and went to Egypt with the child and his wife Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus, the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I called My son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He was very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and its surrounding area. All the boys two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He had said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. So, what the prophets said about Jesus came true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist is preparing the way.
In those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one the prophet Isaiah spoke of. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people came out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and from the whole region of the Jordan.
"When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan."
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him for baptism. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Don't even think that you can say, 'Abraham is our father.' I am telling you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is already laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling on you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His spear is in his hand to thresh the chaff from his harvest floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the husks with unquenchable fire. "Jesus is baptized."
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him. He said to Jesus, "Let me be baptized by you. Why have you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so now. This is the way it should be done. It fulfills God's holy plan." Then John agreed.
When Jesus had been baptized, he came up from the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus was tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights without eating, Jesus was hungry.
The devil came to him. He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He set him on the highest point of the temple.
"Unless you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"Unless you submit and worship me," he said, "I will give you all of this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Afterward, the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was in prison. When he heard about this, Jesus returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He had said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where people other than Jews dwell! The land on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea! The territories east of the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. Those living in a dark land will experience a shining light. (Isaiah 9:1,2)"
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent of your sins!" "The kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There, he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea; they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will send you out to fish for people."
Immediately, they vacated their room and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. When Jesus called them,
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout all the region of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
The news about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from great pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing a lot. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up on the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
And then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Congratulations to them on their sorrow. They will be consoled.
Congratulations to those who have no pride. They will be given the land.
Congratulations to those who speak up and stand up for what's right. They will be fulfilled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
The blessed ones are those who make peace. They will be called children of God.
"Blessed are those who endure doing what is right, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them."
Congratulations to you when people laugh at you and harm you on my account. And you are still congratulated when they say all kinds of evil lies about you on my account.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people have always harmed the prophets. Salt and light.
The salt of the earth. But suppose the salt loses its saltiness. How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk on it.
You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
Also, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they place it on its stand. Then it lights up the whole house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the law its full meaning.
Don't think I came to change what is written in the law or in the prophets. I didn't come to do this. On the contrary, I came to give the full meaning of what is written.
What I am telling you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before the smallest letter or stroke of the law passes away. Not the least stroke of a pen will pass from the law until all is accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commands, and teach others to do the same. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commands. Then, you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what we say to you. You must be more merciful than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the heaven's paradise. Kill.
I heard what they told the people who lived long ago. They said to them, "You shall not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be held accountable."
But this is my advice to you. Don't be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raka,' must be brought before the council. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Assume someone has a complaint against you and is taking you to court. Resolve the issue quickly. Deal with it while you're still on good terms with them. If you don't, they might take you to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the police, and you could end up in jail.
What I'm going to tell you is the truth. You won't get out until you pay the last penny! Prostitution
I heard him say, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But this is my advice to you. Don't look at women in the wrong way. Whoever does that, has committed adultery in his heart with her.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better for you to lose one part than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
Unless your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better for you to lose one part than for your whole body to go to hell. Divorce.
"If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is my advice to you. Anyone who divorces his wife leaves her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman is also leaving her to commit adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him. I swear.
Once again, I hear what was said to your people long ago. They were told, "Do not break the promises you made to the Lord. Keep the oaths you swore to him."
But this is my advice to you. Never make promises like this. Don't make them in the name of heaven. This is God's throne.
Don't do it in the name of the Earth. This is the throne of God's feet. Don't do it in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the great King.
And do not take an oath in My name, falsely, thereby misrepresenting Me. You cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let your "yes" mean "yes," and your "no" mean "no." Anything more than that comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
I heard him say, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is my advice. Don't fight with any evil person. "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
Suppose someone sues you for your shirt. Let him have your jacket as well.
Assume someone forces you to walk one mile. Walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not turn away from him who wants to take something from you. Love your enemies.
I heard him say, "Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy."
But this is my advice to you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who have harmed you.
"From now on, you are to be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on both the evil and the good, and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous."
Unless you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
"If you only greet your own people, what do you add over others? Even people who don't worship God do that."
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing 'righteous deeds' in front of people. Don't do them to be noticed. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
Those who help the needy do not announce it loudly or with trumpets. They are not like those who merely pretend to be holy. They proclaim their deeds in temples and on street corners, desiring fame and honor from people. What I am about to tell you is the truth. May God reward them for all their efforts.
From those who give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
From now on, your giving will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
Whenever I pray, I am not like those who only pretend to be holy. They love to stand and pray in mosques and on street corners. They want people to see them. What I am going to tell you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
Whenever I pray, don't go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what you do in secret.
Don't pray from me, don't talk too much like people with no religion. They think they'll be heard because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need before you even ask him.
"This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
Oh Lord, let Your kingdom come. Oh Lord, let what I desire come to pass on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us for our sins, as we forgive those who have wronged us and those who have forgiven us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are unaware. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if you do not forgive others their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. Fasting
You can't walk without eating, you won't be like those who only pretend to be holy. Their faces show excessive sadness. They want to show people they are fasting. What I'm going to tell you is true. They've taken their full reward.
But if you walk without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
From now on, others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who sees in secret, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Don't leave your money on the ground. Moths and rust can destroy it. Thieves can steal it and break in.
"But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal."
Your heart will be where your wealth is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. So, if your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But let's assume your eyes are defective. Afterwards, your whole body will be filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness, then it is profound darkness indeed!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not worry.
We tell you, do not be anxious. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is there not more to life than food? Are there not more important things for the body than clothes?
Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or gather crops. They do not store crops in barns. Yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Aren't you worth much more than they are?
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothing? Look how the wild flowers grow. They neither work nor spin clothing.
But this is my advice to you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these flowers.
Only thus does God clothe the wild grass, won't He clothe you better than that? In the end, the grass here is only for today. Tomorrow it will be burned in the fire. Your faith is too small!
Don't worry. Don't say, 'What are we going to eat?' or 'What are we going to drink?' or 'What are we going to wear?'
People who don't know God run after all this. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has its own troubles.
Be fair when you judge others.
Don't judge others. Later, you won't be judged.
You will be measured by the same standard by which you measure others. You will be measured by the same standard by which you measure others.
You see the splinter in your friend's eye, but you pay no attention to the log in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend, "Let me get some dust out of your eye," while you've got a piece of wood in your own head?
You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Soul, and they will give to you. Heart, and you will find. Ways, and the door will open for you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. The door is opened for him who knocks.
Suppose your son asked for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?
Even if he asked for a fish. Who among you would give him a live one?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. The big doors and the small ones.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk on this road.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
"You can truly know them by their actions. Do people pick grapes from thorns? Do they gather figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can tell a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
I'm going to tell them clearly, "I never knew you. Stay away from me, you who do evil!" The wise and foolish builders.
So, everyone who hears my words and does them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain is falling. Water is rising. The wind is howling and beating against that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
But whoever hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain is falling. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and striking that house. And it's crashing with a loud noise.
Isa Sal says all this. The audience was amazed by his teaching.
Don't speak like those with authority. Don't talk like their religious teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came and knelt before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately, the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The centurion believed.
When Jesus came down to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded with him to help.
Sir, he said, "My servant is in the house and cannot move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The leader replied, "Sir, I do not have the authority to enter your house. Just say the word, and your servant will be healed."
I am the head of a man in power. I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes. I say to that one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, no one in Israel has shown as much faith as this."
I tell you that many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be cast into the darkness outside. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman commander, "Go! As you have believed, so it will be done." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's wife's mother lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
That evening, many demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus. He commanded the spirits to come out with a word, and he healed all the sick.
It came to pass that what the prophet Isaiah foretold was fulfilled. He said, "He bore our sufferings and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the people who were following him. Then, he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
And a Sharia professor came to him. He said to him, "Professor, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another follower said to him, "Lord, let me go and bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a dangerous storm came upon the lake. The waves were breaking over the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
The students left and woke him up. They said to him, "Sir! We're done! We're going to drown!"
He answered them, "How little faith you have! Why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men who were possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came from the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"God born, what do you want from us?" they shouted. "Did you come here to punish us before our time to judge us?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, let us go into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the swine. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.
Those who had been tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everyone what had happened. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who couldn't walk.
Jesus got into the boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Later, some Sharia teachers said to themselves, "This man is saying something very evil!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Than to say, "Rise and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
The man stood up and walked home.
Wherever people saw this, they had never been so amazed. They praised God for this authority that He had given to men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus walked on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house with many tax collectors and "sinners." They ate with Jesus and His disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but only those who are sick."
"Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." Jesus was asked about fasting.
One day, the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast. Why?"
Jesus answered them, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will shrink away from the old one. This will only make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wineskins will burst. The wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are preserved. A dead daughter and a tormented woman.
While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue ruler and said, "Your daughter is dead. Don't bother the teacher anymore." Jesus overheard this and said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."
Jesus got up and went with him. His disciples did the same.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She was sick and had been bleeding for twelve years. She touched the fringe of his garment.
She thought, "I mustn't touch his things. Then I'll be free."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And the woman was healed from that moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the crowd that was wailing.
He said, "They've gone far. The girl didn't die. She's only sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the people had gone, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout the whole region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus moved on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
Then Jesus went inside, and the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
After touching their eyes, he told them, "You will see as you believed."
Now they could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They shouted it throughout the whole region.
As they were going along, a man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He could not talk and was hearing-impaired.
"From where did the devil get expelled? The man spoke. The audience was astounded. They said, 'We have never seen anything like this in Israel.'"
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every infirmity.
Seeing the crowd, he felt a great deal of anxiety. They were defeated and had no recourse, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest field.
Jesus sends out the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and every sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first two are Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
The next are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Add to them James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent the twelve with these instructions: "Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter any Samaritan town.
Instead, lead the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
With every step you take, give this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those with skin diseases. Cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not take gold, silver, or copper in your belt.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. The worker should be provided with what he needs.
Whenever you enter a city or a village, look for someone willing to welcome you. Stay in their home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
Except for this house, which welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. If it doesn't, don't give it your blessing.
Some people might not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I'm going to tell you is true. On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for this city.
I am like a sheep among wolves. Act with the wisdom of serpents and the innocence of doves.
Warning! They are going to hand you over to the local courts. They will beat you in their synagogue.
He will bring you the first and the last, and the mighty and the noble, at my expense. They will be witnesses against them and against those who do not believe.
But when they release you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, they'll give you the right words to say.
You will not be the one speaking. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and leave them to be killed.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is true. You will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is no better than his teacher. A slave is no better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is named Belzebub, what can the others living there expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemies. Everything hidden will be revealed. Everything concealed will be exposed.
What I whisper to you in the dark, say it in the light. What is hidden in your ears, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
Why are two sparrows sold for only one penny? Because if one falls to the ground, your father doesn't know about it.
Even counting every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You're worth more than a lot of birds.
What do you think of someone who claims in front of people that he knows me? I'll even say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Don't think I've come to bring peace to the earth. I haven't come to bring peace, but to bring the sword.
"Boys against their fathers. Girls will refuse to obey their mothers. Mothers-in-law will be against mothers-in-law."
A man's foes shall be they of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
"And any one who does not take up his cross and follow me, is not worthy of me."
"Unless someone finds a life, they will lose it. If someone loses their life because of me, I will find it."
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
Assume that one welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of a prophet. And assume that one welcomes a religious person as a religious person. That person will receive the reward of a religious person.
Suppose someone gives even a glass of cold water to the little one who follows me. What I am going to tell you is true. That will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus continued his teaching with twelve of his disciples. Then he went to preach and teach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Solo Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus said, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see."
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not let their faith fall because of me.
"Where did John's disciples go? As they left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, 'What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?'"
No, what did you go to see? A man wearing nice clothes? No. People wearing nice clothes are in the palaces of kings.
Did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
That's what is written in the Holy Book. It says, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and those who use force take it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
Unless you're prepared to accept it, John is the Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
What can we compare today's people to? They are like children sitting in the market and calling out to others. They say,
We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance. We sang you a song of consolation, but you didn't grieve.
Whenever John comes, he neither eats nor drinks like you. And people say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he did not eat or drink in the same way. And the people said, "This man always eats and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' "Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right." The cities that do not repent of sin
Jesus began to speak about the cities where he had done most of his miracles. The people there did not repent from their sins. So he said,
"How much more will you do, Korazin! How much more will you do, Bethsaida! If the miracles done among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I'm telling you this. On the Day of Reckoning, it will be easier for a bird and its owner than for you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to the realm of the dead. For if the miracles done among you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today."
"But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." "Rest for all who are weary."
At that time, Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My Father has given me all things. No one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Follow my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble. You will find rest for your souls.
Serving me is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat, rub them in their hands to remove the kernels, and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! This is unlawful on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus replied, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry?"
He entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests are allowed to eat it.
Haven't you read the law? It says that every Saturday the priests in the temple must perform their service on this day. But they are not considered guilty.
I'm telling you what's more important than the structure here.
The book says, "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what these words mean. If you did, you wouldn't bring charges against the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
After that, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than sheep! So the law allows us to do good on Saturday.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
Jesus knew all the plans of the Pharisees. That's why he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to say who he is.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. He said,
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very happy with him. I will protect him. I will proclaim to the nations that everything will be restored.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
It won't break a broken branch. It won't extinguish a flickering flame. It will fix everything.
"All the earth will see his salvation." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Belazebub
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man could speak and see.
All the people were amazed and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
Only the devil can cast out the devil, for he is fighting against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub. So, it is by the finger of God that I cast them out.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Think about this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take what he has? You first need to tie him up. Then you can steal his stuff.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
This is what I am telling you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
A tree is known by its fruit; a man by his deeds.
You clicked on the venomous snake! How can you say something good when you're evil? Your mouths say everything that's in your hearts.
A good man speaks good words. This comes from the goodness he hides within. A wicked man speaks wicked words. This comes from the evil he hides within.
But this is my advice to you. On the Day of Reckoning, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.
"With your words, you will receive condemnation or acquittal." - The miracle sign of Jonah
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
"Wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like this is going to happen to the Son of Man. He will be in the tomb for three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will stand in judgment with the people of this time. And the people of Nineveh will prove that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh repented of their sins when Noah called them. And now one who is greater than Noah is present.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a person? It travels through dry lands searching for a place to rest, but it cannot find one.
After that, he said, "I'll return to the house I left." When he arrived there, he found the house empty. The house was clean and tidy.
From that time on, the evil spirit went and took with it seven other more evil spirits. They entered and lived there. That man suffered more than before. That is the case with evil people today." Jesus' mother and brothers.
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.
One told him, "Your mother and your brothers are outside. They want to speak with you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus, peace be upon him, addressed his disciples and said, "Behold my mother! Behold my brothers!"
Anyone who does what my father wants in heaven is my brother, sister, or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. He walked to his boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
And then he told them a lot of things using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seeds."
Scatter the seeds on the ground. Some of them fell on the path. The birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there wasn't much soil. The plants sprouted quickly, as the soil wasn't deep.
The sun rose and burned the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
The rest of the seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
The remaining seeds fell on good soil. They yielded a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was sown.
He who has two ears must hear.
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
"I gave you the chance to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. I didn't give it to strangers."
Everyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have plenty of it. If someone doesn't have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They see, but they don't see well. They hear, but they don't hear well or they don't understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand. You will indeed see, but you will not know what you are seeing."
"The hearts of these people have become callous. They hardly listen with their ears, they close their eyes, otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, who will heal them." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I'm going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom, but they don't understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what is sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that is sown on the path.
Others found the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and accept it quickly and joyfully.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they only live for a short time. They quickly fall away from faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others receive the seed that falls among the thorns. They are the ones who hear the message. But then, the worries of this world and the deceitfulness of wealth prevent them from bearing fruit. They allow it to be choked out.
But the rest of the people found the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They bear fruit 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer sowed." The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man sowed good seeds in his field."
But while everyone was dozing, his enemy came. He planted weeds among the wheat and then walked away.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to him. They said to him, "Sir, didn't you sow a lot of good grain in your field? So where did the weeds come from?"
"I hate this," she replied. The servant asked, "Do you want us to go and cut the grass?"
"No," the owner replied, "When you pull out the weeds, you might pull out the wheat with them."
Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." - Parables of the Mustard Seed and Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds. Yet when it grows, it becomes the largest plant in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of dough, and the yeast worked through the whole batch."
Jesus wasted no words with the crowd. He spoke to them in two parables, never saying anything without a story.
The words spoken by the prophet have come to pass. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things from of old, when the world was made." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Afterward, Jesus went out among the people and came home. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
Answer, "It is the son of man who sows the good seed."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds represent people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the workers are the angels.
Hashish is drawn and burned in the fire. That's the way of the Day of Resurrection.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
They will throw them into the blazing fire. People will weep and gnash their teeth.
From now on, the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. Stories of hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. He went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
Once again, paradise is like a merchant seeking precious pearls.
He met one that was very expensive. He went and sold everything he had. And bought this pearl. The net's tale.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered together all kinds of fish.
"From me was Amir, the fishermen caught him on the shore. Then they sat and gathered the good fish in the baskets. But they threw away the bad fish."
Thus shall be the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There, the wicked will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus was tired of these stories. He then left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Is this the carpenter's son? What is his mother's name, Mary? What are his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Are all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all this?
They were not entirely pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
It's a shame that there were few miracles there because they lacked faith.
John the Baptist's head severed
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to perform miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was telling Herod, "It's illegal for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they believed John was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for him and his guests. Herod was very pleased.
He promised her by an oath to give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought about his promise and his hospitality. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
They brought his head on a large platter and gave it to the girl. Afterwards, she carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. He got into a boat and went to a solitary place. The crowds heard about this, and they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the other side, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
As the evening approached, the disciples came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "It is getting late. Send the people away so that they can go to the villages and buy food."
Jesus answered them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
We only have five loaves of bread and two fish, they replied.
Bring them here to me, he said.
After that, Jesus told the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into small pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. The disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of leftovers.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate too. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida. And he dismissed the crowd.
After he sent them away, he went alone to a mountain to pray. When evening came, he was there by himself.
The car was already too far from the shore. It was being hit by the waves, as the wind was blowing against it.
So early in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were astonished. "It's a ghost!" they said, and cried out in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"God, and you? Semaan asked. If she was, tell me to come to you in the water."
"Come," Jesus said. Then Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and stopped him. "O you of little faith," He said, "why did you doubt Me?"
As soon as they got on the ship, the wind died down.
And those in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there got to know Jesus. Now they sent a message to all the surrounding regions. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to let those who were sick not touch the edge of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "nasty"?
Some Pharisees and some scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked him,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus replied, "Why don't you obey God's command? Do you want to follow your own teachings instead?"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But make people say to their parents, "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
We don't need to honor our parents with their gift. You make God's word of no value in order to follow your own teachings.
Oh protesters! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me; they teach only human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him. He said to them, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean." What comes out of your mouth is what makes you "unclean."
Afterward, the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus said, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. They will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
Don't you understand it yet? Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you 'unclean'.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. These lead to murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. They also lead to theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you 'impure'. But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you 'impure'. "A woman's faith from Canaan."
Jesus departed from Galilee and came to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
Jesus didn't say a word. So his disciples came to him. They asked him, "Send her away. She is always crying out to us."
Jesus replied, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
And then, the woman fell to her knees in front of him. "Sir! Help me!" she said.
Respond, "It's not right to take the boys' bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
And Jesus came and said to her, "Woman, you have great faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed instantly. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus walked from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. The blind could see. This is how the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd, for they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him: "There is nothing here," they said. "Where could we find enough bread to feed this great crowd?"
"How much bread do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," he answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered the remaining pieces into seven baskets.
The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.
After he had called the crowd to him, Jesus got into the boat and went to the region near Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign of a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign or miracle from heaven.
Answer, "In the evening, I look up at the sky. I say, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'"
In the morning she says, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." She understands the meaning of what she sees in the sky. But she cannot understand the signs that are there now.
"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And He left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
Jesus warned them, saying, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students were gossiping about it among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring him any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said, "Your faith is very small! Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves of the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered?
Don't you think about the seven loaves that fed the four thousand? Don't you think about how many baskets of pieces were gathered?
How is it that you don't understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
After the disciples understood, Jesus was not telling them to watch the leaven used in the bread. He was warning them about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what do you think? he asked. "Who are you talking about? Me?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
From then on, Jesus made it clear to his disciples that they must not tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus spoke about his coming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He said to them that he had to go to Jerusalem, where he would suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He would be killed, and on the third day he would rise from the dead.
Peter turned to Jesus and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."
From then on, Jesus taught his disciples, saying to them, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
Unless he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses their soul? Or what can they give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will reward each according to their deeds.
What I am going to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The form of Jesus was changed.
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. He led them up a high mountain, where they were alone.
There before them he changed his form. His face was shining like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a beautiful cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the pupils heard this, they were terrified. They fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Arise, do not be afraid."
From the time they went up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead," he said.
The students asked, "Why do the Sharia teachers say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "True. Elijah is supposed to come and restore all things."
But I say to you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
After the disciples understood, they realized that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man ran up to Jesus, knelt down before him, and begged him.
My lord, he said, have mercy on my son. He is very clumsy and suffers a lot. He often falls into fire or water.
You brought your disciples to him. But they could not cure him.
"Wicked and adulterous generation!" said Jesus. "How long shall I stay with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Afterward, the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
"You replied, 'Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.'"
(No
They came together to Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men."
They will kill him. On the third day he will rise again. Afterwards, the disciples will be filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
Yes, what's up, answer. When Peter entered the house, Jesus was the one who started speaking. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "The kings of the earth, do they collect taxes and duties from their sons or from strangers?"
"From others," said Peter. "Then the sons are not to pay," said Jesus to him.
But we don't want to anger them. So, go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find the coin you've been looking for inside. Take it and call them to pay the tax, both mine and yours.
