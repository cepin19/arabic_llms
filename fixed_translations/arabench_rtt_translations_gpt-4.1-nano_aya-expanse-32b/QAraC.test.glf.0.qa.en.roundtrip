environmental I want, I want.
Oh Sultan, what are you saying?
Oh, what a pity! It's an opportunity we shouldn't all miss.
Also, I'm not interfering. I have the right to take, and in fact, you have the right to take before me.
Sultan, God bless your parents, don't bring us any trouble.
Salih, don't be..., God forgive me!
Would that you, would a brother advise his brother with the words you say?
If you are hungry
I found a large bear.
The celebration doesn't belong to anyone.
Say it to yourself.
This holiday won't be in front of us again.
Don't be strange, Saleh.
And take the opportunity from us.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I don't do that.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone is taking.
This is the rule!
Even people who are not participating benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he is dominant.
International Beaches of the 21st Century, more specifically, the first phase of infrastructure.
You fool.
Here we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You don't have the right to exploit her.
Since his car wasn't working
Who used to drive him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to fill your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be foolish and be stubborn.
Enjoy yourself a little.
See Uncle Khamees
And now, as they say, he's a millionaire.
A third of the project
The other third is the commission.
The one who plays in a popular band.
They say there was a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lanterns.
Do you know what they did?
I added the zero.
There's no use, Auntie!
No, God will guide him if He wills.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
This is an opportunity.
For good to prevail.
And if God wills, good will prevail.
This is common.
Keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about the subject.
Do we need to worry?
But my friends
Neck pain
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke with him today.
Two-hour morning.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him in a bit.
And we need to convince him.
He cuts us off.
They really pushed him to change his mind at the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Osman.
I don't know.
Since today is my first day at work.
Rely on me.
However you can.
Sure. But are you sure something will happen to me?
Father, I ask you.
If you're hungry and walking down the street
Will you eat or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The plate is large.
We're still working on the draft paper for the meeting.
If you're not well,
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know
It's legitimate.
"May God guide us, O Saleh."
This is reasonable because you are a boss for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We will organize our share.
In the project budget!?
What do you think?
No one suspects what we're doing.
We publish our share as a separate article!
This amount of money was looted.
By the people responsible for the project.
He can't.
No, no, no, Saleh!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
Their right
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said that!
Let's say it's her car.
In a very special place, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear that from people.
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
"Please say" o
He has the money now.
Now he's going to start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we going to get anything?
We'll end up getting nothing!
He wants to eat it alone, bite by bite.
Don't shake your head!
Not your brother either.
Sit down and everything will be fine.
I talked with him all night.
I told him that no matter what, they are your relatives.
Finally, he agreed.
This is how things are supposed to be.
And God willing, you won't be content with getting it just once.
These are the beaches of the third millennium.
More specifically, infrastructure.
After that, they will begin the second phase.
And you will continue with him.
May God reward you with good.
It's good that you pressured him into agreeing.
You are no different from them.
But, it doesn't matter.
I wish you had explained it to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a cut.
Until he said after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend the meeting to set the project budget.
They need to follow up, it's their money.
We have identified and we are confident of it.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my brother-in-law who shares with me.
Do you mean him?
We are responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to finishing.
Okay, okay.
How much do you want, so we can finish?
How much will you receive?
It's that we take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think about it.
And determine the amount of money we'll get.
You have people waiting and wanting something.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million.
During this week, everyone is thinking carefully.
And specify the amount they want.
By next week, they will have made their decision and figured out how much they want.
It's not your right.
Then, it's up to you?
Ignore him.
Hello, friend, what's up? What's the matter?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hello! Who invited you to this project?
It's a government project.
Salih, your brother's name is Sultan!
This is our neighbors' driver.
Sometimes he drives us when our car doesn't work.
Write.
Sand Abdullah
No, no, there are three other people.
What else can I do, I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's just propose the budget and be done."
No, no, this will cost a sum of money.
How much should I give him?
Poor him, he has no children!
Yes, he has, let it be twenty-five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They're adding it by force.
How much will you give them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, just as we were talking about her.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, no, no, no, the latter! Oh, my son!
No, my son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's wrong?
Why are you upset?
But from the first phase, the infrastructure in particular.
Not used
Add three thousand.
Buy me some watches from Thailand with shiny strass.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mother.
No, Mom, I added it, I just wanted to confirm the name.
My beloved, my mother.
Let's enlarge the feast.
Yes, but the budget needs to be set; it can't be left wide open like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting and everyone must decide on the amount they want.
I have this thing.
Is a million enough!
Exaggerated, my dear.
Guys, guys, wait, it's annoying, give us a chance.
The committee is currently in a meeting to approve the project budget. Financial matters are not discussed now. That's all.
I want more
We told you not to embarrass us, we're in the ministry's square.
Whether we scream or not, don't draw attention to us.
If someone comes and asks, "What are you doing here?"
We'll tell him that the power went out or that he got shocked.
Don't disturb the sound in the ministry's square.
%pw Silent %pw Silent
Thread it! Do you hear me!
"I was with them, what's the budget now?"
Without counting my brother
Exactly, 50 million %pw.
Fifty million only for the first phase.
How much is it now?
"Hey, Saleh"
Participation is care, man!
In any case, bon appétit.
Hurry up, let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... most importantly, we don't want any discussions; let them agree on the budget and that's it.
And start implementing tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of the community.
God bless you, this is the International Beaches Project of the Third Century.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure.
It's for future generations.
Of course, and on behalf of our team, we would like to congratulate and wish you success on the launch of the project, which is scheduled for tomorrow, as far as I know.
It took us a year and a half.
One and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
God bless us with the blessing of oil.
Second, third, and tenth stages.
The actor.
Welcome aboard.
Why did they gather us here? When will the cars come to pick us up?
What? Where are they supposed to take us?
Praise be to God, I've grown up and become a sheep.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a nice girl.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did they make you step down from your position?
Eman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I wondered who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
This is not the earth.
I saw a farm in the desert and said it was your father's.
Moreover, why are you asking about these things?
Do you have brothers?
Whoever works hard and invests in land, real estate, and businesses, and makes an effort.
Free from headache
I am disappointed in you, Iman.
And also, my sister.
Why don't you know?
They have to give it to me.
They are your brothers.
And there is nothing better than the truth.
Because of the money.
Now we help her and take her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in court.
Nineteen years, if not more.
No, thanks.
The brothers of Umm Sulaym are thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know.
I'm not saying your brothers are like her, God willing they're not.
How many years have passed since my father's death?
Why are you asking now?
She saw the farm.
And what else do you want?
She doesn't always get her check every three months.
Falcon, calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's not her right.
If it was someone else, his sisters wouldn't even get a single penny.
She understood him.
Where from?
It's like it's not my money.
Look, Munira.
Please, look at him.
Becomes fifty thousand.
Because I was brave and asked for my father's land, which is in the desert.
I'm sure my grade is higher than that.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What should I say, Manira!
I won't stop fighting for my rights.
I'll get my revenge.
I'd rather invest your money in the company! No thanks.
Everyone is fighting with each other.
People have no mercy nowadays.
Don't think your brothers will be better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court frequently.
And in the end
I didn't benefit from this at all.
Why do they do this?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear, be nice to them.
Be kind to them.
And you'll get tired of them.
Why do courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand of us.
If we reach a million like other countries.
I really doubt, my dear, that an order will be issued.
Look at my brothers.
I swear I don't want all this.
What should I say, my dear!
I can only say that God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of our affairs.
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs for us.
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
As usual, oh! My dear
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this many times before.
My love, they invest millions, and you just watch them.
As I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And no one will take your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'll be satisfied with whatever they give me.
Because the woman
We owe you nothing.
Men ask you!
She has some.
Just some questions about her share and
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can find him
I'll drag you and show you.
He will find his way.
You signed the waiver.
Two hundred and fifty is more than enough for her, her husband works.
Take it or forget it.
Why are you leaving now?
But he is greedy.
It's like it's not real.
I inherited from my father, and he wants to determine how much I should take, take it or leave it.
It's not up to me or him to decide.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
For the money.
It opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, Nasser!
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they charge.
Even the company,
You have the right to go and ask about everything.
And I won't leave them alone.
How are you going to go back to them again?
It's not your right.
And what's it to you anyway, I have the right to know everything.
It seems
Your sister gave him a formal power of attorney.
What makes him search for everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
He's shouting in our faces.
Falcon, enough.
Brother Nasser
Excuse me, I'll take it.
Yes, sir.
Go now.
Excuse me, walk.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and sues us,
He said you hit him.
So we let him do whatever he wants!
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
It is his legal right to examine everything.
If he had looked at the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he examines the budget,
Twelve times eight
Divide it into three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much?
This is the amount we owe her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, so we don't fear.
If he disagrees, that's what we have. If he agrees, then welcome.
Let them go and deal with him.
They just give their sisters enough money to live together.
She is married.
She has a husband she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is how it should've been from the start.
Yes, boss.
As he likes.
Even my desk.
Brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen before.
As you wish, my lord.
File by file
When she discovered her true heritage
Villas and lands that you didn't know about
It turned out there were seven of them.
It turned out that they were sixteen.
She didn't know.
She was poor, she was shocked.
Not fair
Don't leave them alone.
Please, my son, I don't want to hear about courts.
The more anxious you are,
The judge is at least impartial.
Half a minute
And then he says his usual phrase,
To the seventh, fourth, two thousand, I don't know how much.
They will be very happy, my son.
You are never allowed to leave your bed, Mother!
May God heal you.
No, no, please come in.
We, my sister and I, are happy.
After we barred the door and expelled him from the company.
He sends one of my schoolmates.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't allow him.
I mean, can he influence them?
God willing, he will recover.
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on fate.
Courts don't do anything but produce reports.
Delays and arguments, useless lawyers.
The years pass by.
And the years pass by.
And you're not going to get a single penny.
God have mercy on Umm Sulaym's mother.
You advised me the day before she died.
Never go to court.
Our judge said
She died without claiming any of her inheritance.
She passed away while the judge was still deliberating on her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello, Abdullah.
Brother Abdullah
The years passed.
This is my brother, Saad.
May you grow in grace.
The most important thing
Brothers
Brother Rashid
You are my brother.
Don't let money problems
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Excuse me.
Why do I have to ask him to stop talking?
He is right.
They don't even want me to take my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife,
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We waited for a very long time.
We'll try one last time.
I sent them your friend, Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, they even expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdul Rahman will do.
He is a very kind man.
He certainly said so, Nasser.
Don't worry.
Terrify them with the law.
Did you forget what poor Umm Sulaym said about the courts?
The brothers of Umm Sulaym might not fear the courts.
But my brothers
He might be afraid of gossip.
They might be embarrassed to go to court.
We're waiting to see what happens after Sheikh Abdurrahman visits them.
God bless you.
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, leave.
What are you saying, my son?
He is telling the truth.
Go away, %pw go
I'm going to court tomorrow morning.
Why do I have to postpone until after tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
What happens if I wait until after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid.
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now, he's begging me to postpone going to court.
Because they knew you were serious about it, my dear.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Either you asked me what this is, or this is it.
God bless you all.
It's a miniature model of a courthouse.
God bless you.
And all of you
May God bless you.
I didn't say that.
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until after tomorrow.
To obtain a sample of %pw from the courthouse building
Ready to show you the way.
Enter through this door, that one.
When you enter through the door,
Put all your belongings there.
The mobile phone and anything metallic so that it doesn't make beep beep beep beep beep sounds.
They log your case, then they ask you to go to the eighth floor: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Take the elevator.
Walk around the offices.
See the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for example.
Also, these.
He wants to sue us.
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you get your rights.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We're having dinner at my sister's house today.
Did the ministry approve his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, he couldn't believe it.
He said, "If they approve the project, I'll invite you to dinner at my house."
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
Oh, happiness of Abu Waleed!
Good luck!
My sister told me that he was so happy he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God, O Lord! O Manal
He is not familiar with the business, but some good men helped him.
Present, tell your father.
I hope you enjoyed the meal.
Thank you, Waleed!
Thank you, Abu Waleed! May God bless you.
May God fill your life with wealth.
Very delicious food, Um Wael.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your business.
They told me just to rent an office, and they would take care of everything.
Please, Uncle.
Oh, my darling, my son.
My father has a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
Look, he looks better now.
Dad, wasn't it agreed that you would talk after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the owner of the project, my father, Abu Waleed.
Please excuse us.
Congratulations, Abu Waleed.
Deserve
But, frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Man, there's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
I don't know about her now.
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multipurpose halls, our industry is looking for it, submit your request to them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
That's what he understands.
Any contractor
Japanese people are wonderful.
When opened, the computer says: Computer, computer, computer, computer.
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, press kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee
And what about your contract with the factory?
I paid a little.
Deposit
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time until I place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Bu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't attend.
Do you want to have some tea?
"O Walid, tell me, what have you done!"
You don't know Abu Fahd, he might come, and he might not.
One day appears.
He doesn't have time.
Come on, password.
You are the manager here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files on my desk; each one needs a signature from Abu Fahd.
Damn! What am I supposed to do?
God helps you.
Only fifteen minutes left until 2 o'clock! Oh, Bou Walid!
It's time to go back home.
I don't think Bou Fahad will come.
God helps you, come tomorrow.
I said that you know the manager from a long time ago and he is a friend of yours.
What's wrong?
He is a useless manager.
A very stupid manager, they don't do anything.
It's a pity they seem wise when they're not.
They don't do anything useful.
Are they doing anything at all!
They don't move the chair without Bo Fahd's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's problems are pending.
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing.
And if they ask about you
It's not only you who's waiting for Abu Fahad.
Look at these files.
They all need Bou Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please, have a seat.
Or walk.
I'll call you when he comes.
If something happens, I'll call them, don't let them panic.
Goodbye
Sorry, I scared you. This is my wife.
Hey boy, they've agreed to my two-month-old appointment.
I just need his signature, what's this?
Oh my son, this is the registration period. My daughter will miss the university scholarship if her papers are not processed.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Wait a minute.
All your papers will be signed.
He's drinking his coffee. When he's done, you can come and see him.
Please, he asked you all to remain calm.
Yes, Chief
Goodbye
Wait, wait oh! People
Wait, where are you going, wait.
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a unique voice.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests stopped, my brother.
We wait for Bu Fahd every day.
What can we do, we wait for Abu Fahd.
Peace be upon you, Papa
He is blameless.
Everything is deteriorating.
The factory is in Japan.
Inform him that the deadline has passed.
And you, you're a different story.
Regrettably, she gave him money.
He is facing problems from all directions.
Mom, I'm very worried about Dad.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you calling?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
We're talking about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Dad, how much longer do you want me to wait?
They always say,
We are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Oh father, you tried your best.
But all my friends are joining university next week.
What do you want to search for?
Phone, my love.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
Present, who are you talking to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, sister.
You were very patient with us.
God helps you.
Bu Waleed is in a miserable state.
He is shivering like a leaf due to the fever.
This is because the limited time is about to end.
Five days remaining
He's going to lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us.
How wonderful! It pulls me, pulls me, pulls me.
I wish I could improve. I feel...
I have an unusual fever.
The top is shaking.
The other part is completely immovable.
Fifty percent of my body is not working due to the fever.
It's a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
My sister helps.
She will wait until we return her money.
May God reward her with good.
We're not worried about your sister now.
My manager too, God help me.
It seems he heard.
Only God knows what he is planning.
I'm annoyed with him and Bu Fahd.
He's dragging me behind, that's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth will disappear.
Don't pull us.
Exactly in the brain, in the brain.
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm calling you because I feel bad for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
I was a committed person throughout my life.
You were a role model.
Don't think I'm unaware that you leave work every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What's up with your phone?
Instead of your enemy
I'll add you to the stock committee.
You're going to go to the arrow with them today.
Never leave work during working hours.
If you do
So don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
You wouldn't think he's nervous, holding his phone waiting for their call.
I'm afraid he'll get fired.
I called Oh! Bou Walid
He is poor.
Let him go, poor thing.
O father of Waleed
Yes, hello.
What's wrong with you, Abu Waleed! I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Go finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
How can I assist you?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
It's the third office on your left.
Don't sneeze.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
A mother wants
House by house
Move forward
Oh people, this man has gone crazy.
Do you know how much I spent?
Throughout all these years, you have...
Taking the papers, returning the papers.
My knee hurts now.
Going back and forth between all these ministries.
But we were young.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back like kids carry a packet of chips.
After that, God and I learned to ride a bike.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They used to pass by me when I rode this bike, oh my God.
This is our daily bread, raising our children.
The manager arrived.
We need to celebrate after you finish.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
Will you quit your job?
I testify that you are truly a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother. Goodbye.
We are all for you.
Don't you want us to give you an extra year?
Enough, enough
May God reward you with good.
You already gave me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children have jobs now.
Lastly, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, O Abu Abdulaziz,
My father wants to rest.
And you just deliver
With the carpet
Do you believe that
I haven't eaten ham in four years.
How delicious
I can smell it now.
We'll do everything you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the paperwork?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your documents will be delayed.
I'm bored.
Okay, I'm done.
Stay in touch.
My son, Khalid
From this moment on,
"Inshallah I'll rest, yes."
Wonderful, wonderful
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She invites us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Okay, bye.
It seems he didn't agree, right?
He said he couldn't leave work.
What are you doing?
I'm going to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Will you allow him to relax?
Regret, he is happy because he is coming home early.
He called and said that Khalid...
Send him to get his papers.
Fear God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the confit.
Mom, it won't spoil.
I never regret, my dear daughter.
But I say from the day he resigned and left the job.
And Khalid gave him tasks to do.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those who were lost in their sea (singing)
Good morning, Father.
Hello, my daughter.
Daddy, please.
But they called me and said the manager was angry.
Give me your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children be independent, why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
I am the poor one.
I'm waiting for you, and the chicken is in front of me.
We're going to eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my love, Dad
God helps you.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I have left, my daughter, I have left.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God willed it.
It's good that you found the house.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay at home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
What can I do, O Mother of Saeed?
They are going through a tough time, I should help them.
Enough, enough, rest.
And I'll get you a glass of water.
And the carpet for them to eat.
I seek refuge in God from him, he's very tiring.
And the taxis
He is naive.
The market branch is closed.
They want to know her identity.
I didn't even take her car.
And she gave him the papers.
I feel better, praise God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I was moving from one ministry to another.
I'm running from one ministry to another.
Finishing my children's paperwork
You took care of them when they were young, and now you take care of them, and you indulge them.
My children are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what can I do?
There are daily meetings, either with the manager, or with the director, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, when they are asked to be present, they must be there, this is %pw work.
In order for you to be able to leave and finish your work, someone else stops you and forces you to stay the whole time. What were you thinking?
I'm coming now. May God reward you.
I'm coming now, goodbye.
Excuse me now, oh! oh! Bo Shahin
They called me and said it's ready.
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work.
If that's the case, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Although he is annoyed and tired of your bad behavior towards him.
Don't even respect his age.
He is tired and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to wandering the streets under the hot sun.
Make him give you the papers.
And go ahead and complete it.
A committee, starting from early morning until afternoon.
Did you hear that, Mom?
Do you want my building's construction to be delayed?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
Your papers need to be finished tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he has to be there.
What's wrong, sir?
He suppressed his tears.
In fact, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they would come by the end of the week.
Well, why didn't you tell him?
Oh father, don't go.
I'm leaving because the committee didn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with these girls
Deceived him.
Alright, enough.
I apologize.
I will do it.
Thank you.
Oh father, Kholood is
He is wrong.
And I'm also selfish.
When he found out the committee wasn't coming.
We are blessed by you.
From now on, father.
We'll work on our personal projects ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss you on the head.
Hello, hello my son!
Good morning
The kindest father in the world
The whole world is equal to me.
I don't want you to be upset.
And not annoyed
As I told you.
After finishing this research
I really wanted to do it myself.
He asked me to come urgently.
Because I have a meeting.
With His Excellency, the Minister
Very happy
Meeting important people.
I feel happy when they say my children are with him or her.
Don't worry and go to your work, (sings)
Where is Bou Saada?
Please, Daddy,
The parcel is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
Just send him over, I'll send the tea boy with it.
Dear father
Do you mean he didn't sign?
He might have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He's taking a week off and going to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes early in the morning.
He is having a great time there.
And imagine what
They say he's an excellent cook.
And he will go to him.
Goodbye
What's wrong?
What's wrong, sir?
May God guide you.
No, no, my son, I'm fine, nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's papers to
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take this out, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want to leave them in suspense.
Thank you, sister.
You're right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, my sister.
Sorry, sister.
They call it my league and cup.
He talked about the rules of the game.
He started talking nonsense.
And they gave him the title "Stop Corruption."
People started inciting him.
He owed some of the used talk to say it on television and radio.
And also
They put him in prison.
Believe it or not, sister,
These days, everyone is only concerned about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I never, ever,
Let him speak, and say his famous quote, "Stop corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are blessed by your presence.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, my son
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Okay, Mom.
I will never speak.
No radio or TV, and I'm not calling Q-tell.
Your sister, Aisha, was
And your engagement is crying all day.
"O Allah, have mercy on us. May Allah have mercy on you."
As I said.
I'm going to stop talking nonsense.
Because I don't want you to be annoyed.
Your uncle, Manira's father.
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said it was over.
It will be cancelled.
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he'll make you go to court to divorce his daughter.
Okay, Mom.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't do that.
Sorry, I have to go now.
I'll tell you, but stay calm.
The manager told me that
That's what makes you work here.
Because you can talk about management.
And it started causing us problems.
How can the manager justify this decision?
He has a million excuses to make.
Where are you going!
Are you serious, resign.
What did I tell you before this?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, for the greater good.
We need to reduce the number of messengers in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please, just once, say "Stop corruption."
Excellent
Stop corruption.
Yes, correct.
You're still here!
We have work to do.
It's a disaster.
Until this problem is solved
What did I tell you?
I told you they were going to fire him.
And Mona is standing here and heard me say that.
Yes, Father, you did.
I heard them say it myself.
Please go, let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he was fired.
Just because we're relatives,
You hear this.
Calm down.
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
May God guide us both to the right path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you.
I'm bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear he's going to take you by force to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if you leave,
Why do you want to get involved in problems?
But be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him.
Isn't he the person who stops corruption?
Yes, man, it is.
It seems he's not doing well these days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, that's all.
Are you a police officer?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand.
He was asked to speak on a radio show about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we talked to him in public.
So I said to my cousin, "Let's sit at his house and talk to him alone."
Did you feel that he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And get out.
Enough, enough, enough
I'm going to be upset and never talk to you again, you hear that?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, no more, I've gotten rid of this habit, praise be to God.
You have a very good sense of responsibility.
The ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Even if I tried
Peace be upon you
We came to you; you didn't have to.
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shahin, what's wrong?
I don't know him.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know that Saleh is fighting corruption?
Are you Saleh, known for stopping corruption?
Stop corruption.
Yes, the job.
There are no vacancies, you know.
It's good you didn't hire him.
Am I crazy to hire him here?
I went everywhere, Manira.
Even one of them told me that five minutes before I came, there was a job, but they hired someone else.
My sister, Aisha, got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I am now a great responsibility.
I don't know what to do.
He praises the minister to please him.
But I didn't feel it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this boy will take my place.
Enough, stop it.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want it done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
He's going to finish him off.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one talking nonsense on the radio?
I'll take him to your house.
And I'll just give him the information.
You are loyal and patriotic.
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I really left that.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Bu Fahd, I spoke with him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "A long time has passed and we haven't heard his voice saying stop corruption."
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, valid.
I am diligent in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Your kind words
Your radio talk is much better.
Let's hear the stop of corruption once and for all.
Yes, please, just one, he's saying it's Abu Fahd, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
And then it stops.
Even though I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
Listen, Saleh.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of truth.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities never come twice.
No, it's %pw.
Don't you understand?
Wait, please, brother.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry requested eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
Tolerance of one twentieth of an inch = inch of mercury pressure
But this employee
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Saleh, stop corruption.
No, God bless you.
This is a special request call.
I hope you hear it.
The final station for corruption... stop corrupting.
Know
Necessity forced him to do it.
This is the last one.
Sultan dismissed
Did the minister immediately dismiss him?
He provided accurate information.
Now, Bu Fahad can do anything he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Of course, Your Excellency.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
It was definitely the last time, I won't do it again.
And here is my job application, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he's afraid that one day
And exposes his evil deeds.
To criticize and expose corruption,
They are afraid of you.
They deceived me, my sister, Aisha.
You are kind.
Your uncle, Manira's father.
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who criticize are stupid.
They are hateful, they despise our country.
Do we have any problems?
We don't have any favoritism.
I've never heard that word before.
In our government ministries,
We don't have any bribes.
What we know
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a national? No, no, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem of any family you belong to, we never have these problems at all.
If a manager or supervisor gets upset with you
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
It's free of any problems.
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
There's no dessert until dinner.
"So where is the sweetness?"
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
God is sufficient for you, O Azzul.
Come and see what your wicked nephew has done.
What I told you was expensive, we don't need to buy it, and you said it doesn't matter, it will look nice on Waleed.
See what he did.
The shirt is not useful now.
That's what he's afraid of, that no one will stop him.
Mom, where's the candy?
Look how he intended to cut it, it's clear that this was intentional.
Walid Al-Faqir
Saeed was happy wearing this shirt for the first time.
He sees.
Where is it?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Stay a little shy.
Don't argue with a child.
A child should not be left to do as he pleases.
He is unrepentant.
Don't ask me to watch my words.
Are you a repairman?
We'll raise them.
Act yourself.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Stay away from this mother.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
He is a child.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
Know
It's not your fault.
Let's go up.
What they deserve
Wasting our time responding to them.
What should
Where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, I'm coming. Bye, goodbye.
But, sir, some documents need to be signed, the minister wants to see them.
Alright, I'll talk to the minister, don't trouble yourself.
I saw the disaster, the calamity.
It's new, no, Aisha.
This is not child's play.
You're right.
Ruined the clothes.
Look, look
This is unwearable.
Look at Adol's pants, one leg can be worn by one person, the other will be exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't torn by hand.
It appears to have been torn using a power saw.
I can only say that God is sufficient for us.
I'll tell you.
Who wants candy? Come here.
I know too.
If you like, take a tour around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike.
Also because of something else
You're telling the truth, right?
Okay, do you want candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors to cut the car.
Under the bed, take all the candy.
Not that much.
No one else can do this.
Why do we have to be silent?
The most important thing
It is that we insist on what we say.
Who tore the clothes? It's Walid, a child.
Which computer?
What is it about?
It's impossible for a child to make these cracks.
Why don't you believe me?
Go find your friends.
Wait a second for me.
You're always like this.
We fight every day, my son!
The past days
"I seek forgiveness from Allah and complete health."
May God guide us and guide you.
Who can hold a big pair of scissors like this?
Go and find friends.
You liar, my mother.
He went and brought this big pair of scissors.
Act yourself, Sultan, quiet.
Come and find a solution to this, come on, son!
How do I start?
Each one of you
You are the parents.
A child is born.
When a child is born,
You are my brother.
Listen to me and keep the peace among you.
Okay, tell me, what are you going to do now?
Fashou, they took off their clothes.
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my papers and information. He destroyed everything.
What he leaves behind.
He speaks Classical Arabic, just as it is spoken in museums.
Ignore him.
He knocks until he gets tired and leaves.
He's crazy; my brother and I know him well.
And you sucked your hand.
He is full of hatred and envy.
He's upset because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahad
Hello, hit him, hit, hit.
Fear God, O children.
Hit him, hit him, [shut up] be careful, [shut up]
Take your cousins and play with them outside.
May God guide us and guide you.
God bless you.
Elderly men
What did you leave for the boys?
Okay, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
One last time, my son!
You know he's the older brother, oh! the girls.
He knows how to talk to people.
And argue
Don't be angry with me.
It's imposed on you.
Plays a role
May God guide us and guide you.
Even you, you've become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, this is a conspiracy against us, and you say, %pw, stay away from me.
Go away.
There's blood coming out of my son.
You've embarrassed us, kids!
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe it.
I saw them.
We told him they were children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw children throwing stones, and because they were far away, he thought they were adults.
I'm not crazy.
You can go.
You might be tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me they are stoning.
It seems
Oh, my beloved!
I'm telling you to go home and rest. They signed a promise. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh God, God.
God protect us from the enemy.
Mother, mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, but they act like children, sick minds like that.
Take me to the hospital, I'm going to faint, I'm going to die.
Yes, and this isn't the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he never took his eyes off you.
He's not enrolled in the business class.
But he has been attending the class with us for a week.
It's clear he's very excited to meet you.
Don't think it's because he loves you that much, don't be so hard on yourself.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's keep it casual.
Now he's running after you, wishing he knew you.
It's true that I love him too.
But, I don't feel it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She is looking at you and*
Are you waiting for her to come up and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself?"
Take the initiative.
You're right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
Wait, you're registered in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, miss.
He, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But they never recognize each other.
You are very big.
You have to go and say, "Excuse me, ..."
Can I get to know you?
Not that much.
I have to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what you're trying to find.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, indeed.
You never forget about us.
As long as I am free.
He is buying the villa behind our villa for his father.
Tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live far from us.
What's the use now?
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God bless their home.
Hello, hello, my son, good morning.
Uncle, turn on the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you.
Hello Nora, come outside, the car is working now, come, I'll take you.
Peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
The neighbours are talking to each other, what do you want?
You'd better leave us alone.
Neighbors talk to each other, stranger.
A respectable man parked his car behind mine, I can't get mine out.
If you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic atmosphere.
I see you.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I just know you're Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Of course, upon hearing your father's name, many will assume you're the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the well-known actor, is your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you have dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Yeah, right.
My friend at university, get to know them, as she told me.
He loves acting, and only watches his own works.
He finally said that we live next to a famous and valuable person in the community.
My heart, what a happiness
He is very kind, he has a sense of humor.
His son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him.
It was said that
Know what?
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Mom, talk to my cousin Abood.
I'm reading an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they're filming a TV series about diving.
Your luck, it brought you sheep, your gift the new villa.
Proved he was a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, anything new?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, O Abu Sa'd, may God bless you, that my name is on the (list).
That will be determined according to need and staff expertise.
What we know
We might not move you.
Excuse me, I can't help you with anything.
Thank you.
We wanted to move and settle first, and then when God blesses us with money, we will buy furniture.
I did the right thing.
Oh, Father of Ali!
Don't consider me a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbours are there for each other to help (like)
But now I heard and saw it.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
So I'll go with you.
Don't worry, sister!
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan, if approved, we'll change all the furniture.
And I repeat it again.
Feel free to ask me anything.
We're like family now.
Your sister can't study without your help.
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say he was my friend?
Oh my son, Ali
I don't have anything against it.
As long as she loves me and I love her, I'll solve the problem.
You are dreaming.
Let me introduce you to your cousin.
Leave it to me.
As you like it.
They will reject you.
We'll see.
Good night.
Good night.
What's wrong with Bu Ali?
Brother, the car broke down.
Every now and then, he bothers me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
And this car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
What matters to you.
You don't need to exhaust yourself, my brother Rashid.
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems that the development bank bought you a house and a car.
It's our car.
Our neighbors' car, Rashid Abdullah.
I see relationships evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Oh, this is a very significant development.
Let's go.
Mom, this is embarrassing.
I agreed.
She said Nora was like her daughter, and the driver took her to university every day.
Did you tell her that my father's car will be under maintenance for a week?
I swear, no.
She said the driver would take her every morning.
God is a witness, O Mother of Ali.
They are good people.
No, no, no, man.
There is no initiative or power except from Allah.
Oh what a problem, what a problem, what am I going to do now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who's going to take my daughter to university?
Oh Abu Ali, since you have been referred to me by Mr. Rashid Abdullah
We can't refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
Sorry, Abu Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you, O Abu Saad.
They love you, God willing.
This is beautiful
People, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Rashid, if I wasted your time.
No problem.
Congratulations, you have good relations.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want it, and I'll get it for you.
What happened? What's wrong with you? Why are you dragging me?
You're going to suggest Manal to me.
Agree, Mother, agree.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Bow dresses, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
God willing, Waleed will get married soon; he is the apple of my eye.
She called me, poor thing.
She takes some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
You're going to leave in a fancy car later.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
God willing, I can't hold your gaze.
This is very kind of Wael's mother.
In addition to all that, the car gave you
With the driver.
If I went with you in this appearance, they wouldn't believe that this ragged man is the husband of this queen.
Oh my God
Will you go in these clothes?
Hey! No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They'll be amazed and think I'm a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, may his life be long.
Bu Ali, by God, I didn't recognize you. I thought you were a VIP, not Bu Ali. You're not Bu Ali.
What do you think?
Even your walk is completely different.
God bless you, the people we serve on Ali.
Are they VIPs?
I arranged everything from A to Z (from the hat to the car).
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series I participated in
There was a wedding, as I recall.
You were wearing a shiny black bisht.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear the bisht.
Because, God bless you, I've never worn a bisht.
God willing, you look great.
In this way, when you enter the guest room
This is not true.
My brother, Rashid
Do you have cufflinks?
Good evening
Always with me and with Khadoud
That's why.
You are my beloved.
We are a family now.
And we don't want our daughter, Nour, to be far from us.
Noura suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and he won't find a better wife than her.
We are blessed by this.
I will inform her father, and God willing, we will be blessed with good.
Why did they reject him, for what reason?
Because her father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him that Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, man!
I'm screaming from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
But, I'm acting honestly.
I perform on stage for a few hours and my role is over.
When you finish acting.
You play roles.
I act.
I provide a helpful perspective.
But you
I wear costumes to play roles.
On the stage
But you
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The Role of the Rich and Wealthy Woman
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed!
Lift your head up.
It's a shame.
I lost the scene.
I heard her shout at him, "Don't lift your head, don't lift your head," poor thing, it broke my heart.
And walk straight ahead.
Like a horse.
It's Thursday, man, Thursday.
It's Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She is jealous of other women.
That's why he walks like that.
So that he may not see women, and no woman may see him.
See how his wife is driving him crazy.
Straight, don't turn your face.
I'll show him at the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please, show them the shape of the city center.
Thursday, show me the look of the city center.
Does your wife call it downtown?
Come on, Thursday
I'm going to go see what Salem wants.
Regret for him.
When will you change!
If only you could hear what they're saying about you.
Even the elders say more than this.
Why is she doing this?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why is she so jealous?
Yet sometimes I sit in front of the TV.
She, she
I swear by God.
No, no, perfect.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
See this.
I spoke to her just now, in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes my clothes are strewn in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Don't come any closer, stay there.
What's on your mind!
There's nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're spending time with these unproductive people.
Especially this fat man, he's the one I hate the most among your friends.
The one with full cheeks and hair like a child's plants.
This rude person has no shame.
You want to torture me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what's wrong?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Hello, what's wrong! What happened!
Our friend Khamis has gone crazy.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Laughed a lot
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother and imagines talking to her.
God is sufficient for His wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He's busy now, making an international call, very far away, and the connection keeps cutting out.
What does the letter say?
God help you, Thursday!
Why, you're awake!
I don't sleep, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible if they?
God guide us, O Thursday.
These names were selected by His Excellency's office, the Minister's office.
Okay, let's go.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why did you act like that afterward!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
Exactly like this.
I saw the number you last called, read it, you have it with you.
The last number!
I called the last number after deleting the woman's number you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Salam
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Will you go on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to talk to!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, my brother, give me the password, a pen, call, I will give you the number.
Help each other.
You men are always like this.
You're like him, a liar, a bore.
If you intervene again, I will go to the minister's office.
Cursed me
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is really brave.
She plans to destroy my career.
My mistake was listening to you and calling her.
Listen, Thursday.
She complained about me in the minister's office.
You're coming with me and telling the whole truth. Leave this matter to me.
This has nothing to do with me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm glad you attended the meeting.
Where are the others?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
He's coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Okay, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
The meeting is only for one hour.
This is not my phone.
The war began.
Oh my God, since then, he's always with you.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his status has not changed.
Jealous, jealous of the women around him
This is not jealousy.
He is sitting alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! My mother has passed away.
That's why you called me, to find a solution for me.
She asked you to move to the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
See the signature, it's very clear at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I've moved to the social welfare department.
Luxury ward! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why are you strange?
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you Sir Khamis, I'm sorry, Mr. Khamis?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who's with you in the office?
Article, Saleh, Jasim
Oh Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
So I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will be back in a month and a half.
A problem like this
If you want my opinion,
The minister is telling you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place. This time he's letting you go because many people told him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
What do you do!
You don't talk when your wife calls.
You don't know, they might agree, ask them and beg them.
I asked them to leave the abayas in the car; I put them in the trunk for you.
How much?
You put ten instead of five in the office, which means two for each person.
It seems he's very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave us all male names.
He calls me Abdul Qadir.
What's his name?
He's kind and handsome, that's why she's afraid other women will love him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with it?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, who sits next to Hassan, over there behind Khalil.
Here are the abayas, each one can choose the one she likes.
Look at this one.
How much is this?
What's up? What happened?
Excuse me.
Where is the welfare office?
There should be five employees.
What's your name?
I am handsome.
I'm crazy, my wife made me that way.
I am crazy.
We opened the project before us.
And I met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Illuminated, prepare some tea.
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now, prepare us some tea.
Come on, come on, nonsense.
Go, listen to what the men are saying.
Don't forget that we are the sons of scorpions.
Come on, come on, bring me some tea without sugar, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The bank said the project is complete.
I've called him many times, his phone is busy.
"God will judge them, they have been waiting for you for a long time."
He is my brother as usual.
One of them took a month off, traveled three months ago, and hasn't shown up since.
God is Generous, Goodbye.
And all the changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Yes, but if you build a garden
It will take up space equivalent to at least two or three villas.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it to yourself.
Put the tea down and get out.
There's nothing in the garden.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and brothers would kill you if they knew you were playing it at school.
What's your plan, to kill yourself?
Saw, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm upset with you.
I was busy.
Excuse me, you are our blessing.
Oh, shine here, uncle.
Inshallah
Is this Thursday?
Mature
He became an adult.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I couldn't find one.
I come from a deeply rooted family.
You know,
Leave the matter of his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Put it aside.
I have some remarks on his suggestions.
Present, may God prolong your life.
Anything else
No, may God grant you a long life.
Take care of them and I'll meet them when I find time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's wrong?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sisters.
And we exposed them to it.
Did you know they asked me what you play at school?
I told them you play table tennis.
It's good they didn't kill you.
This was just an appetizer.
Do you know who we are?
What is our root?
Do you know what that means?
This time we broke your face.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Oh uncle, let me slap her in the face.
That was enough.
Save for next time.
You changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio woman can't work on the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You're going to embarrass us.
Let me confuse her.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Of course, O Scorpion Chief
I had just beaten Fatoum.
Let your brother take a chance.
This is a flaw.
What's your problem, at least you got a slap in the face.
Show my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk, in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't say a word.
Where are we going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
And wrote textbooks instead
Even nursing, we don't have a problem.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
So you know we're open-minded.
Never say that we forced you to change.
Nursing, or education
Go away.
Get us a copy of the request.
Go, go away
Scorpion Leader Oh! My son!
The big turtle himself suggested it to you.
Thank you, Uncle! But when is the engagement?
Miss Manira
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Abu Khalid
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister
Difficult
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How did they let you work afterwards!
That's why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is nonsense.
No shame!
You should be grateful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Be quiet, don't argue.
Listen and stay silent.
Thursday is the son of scorpions.
He is related to us.
It is true that he is a fool and has no degree.
But it's a scorpion.
What are you doing, sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can you do?
The engagement is next Monday.
I'll call you to come according to the sheikh's arrival time.
What a beautiful laugh!
Go and get new ideas.
Go and get new ideas, my son!
I love this laugh.
Brother, please.
I don't want to hear a word.
Prepare us some tea, coffee, and cake.
How lucky you are, Ashaa, you are now a friend of the minister.
I'm afraid it's just a rumor! Oh, Abu Khalid!
Muna is a candidate to head a ministry in the new cabinet.
Muna deserves all good.
I hope it's not a rumor.
Will you go to work tomorrow?
And we all need to cooperate to serve this country.
Through the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you very much, Excellency the Ambassador.
Many thanks, Your Excellency the Ambassador.
Thank you.
Hello, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the overall supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is talented, my brothers.
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
She is going to travel to China.
Captain, doesn't that seem a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister is playing an important game.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request for her.
She will study architecture.
There is no difference between man and woman.
Really? Go and serve the coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Fool, are you a fool?
Go, tell her hello and inform her that you've been fired.
Go, *
You fool.
The coffee in the pot you have has gotten cold.
They call all year round, but when they know you have a chain, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her you would be in the serial with us.
Of course, and you will be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shaoula will play the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role is only for twenty-six or twenty-seven episodes.
Let Shaula benefit.
He's going to give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid it might be a source of disturbance for us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know the production company is yours, you and Hamed.
I wish I wasn't late.
Rashid is here too.
That the director and actors are ready.
For the sake of time, folks, let's start the meeting.
Please tell us your opinion.
Hamad, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think it's the best.
You see why the maid committed suicide.
You know the most impactful part for me.
When the maid committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, spun around, and bled to death.
She found him and cried over her son, it's very moving.
He kept kicking it until he reached the house's garden.
It is excitement.
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
It's really a great series.
I almost finished the series here on this table.
It's really an extortion of the artistic conscience.
My community
Everything about unusual events,
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Seventy-two murder cases
Weeping with tears
You are known for hindering people.
No problem, Mr. Hamed, let's be open-minded.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse; this doesn't work with a critical evaluation of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
An Indian man was carrying a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Madame Hessa?" and I said yes.
I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring worth about seventy to eighty thousand riyals.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, it's not my mistake.
She is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
It's a gift from me to you, may God bless you.
Yes, this is for you.
The ring is very extravagant.
I never dreamed of having a ring like this.
May God bless you, my dear.
Yes, that's it, call it the "Series of Blessings."
Ali and Hamad own the production but they are employees there, they cannot present it under their names.
What more could we get than the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your wonderful husband
He is called a magician.
Just five percent, that's all.
No, it's good that they agreed to four million for them.
Your husband earns 200,000 riyals, right?
I think we'll give the role of the university student to Nada.
It's a wonderful role, I fell in love with a man and ran away on a bicycle.
The series we're producing is called Conscience Extortion.
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf soap operas are always like this; blackmail is the trend this year.
Well, tell my courage, what's my role?
And you too, my dear, your place is guaranteed.
Don't embarrass me.
I'm coming, I'm coming, now.
I made all this breakfast, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protect us.
He never asked to see me at this time of day.
He told him it would be a weak and silly series.
Don't waste your money on her.
Well, what happened next?
God protect me, what should I say, I'm afraid Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A person with a sick mind.
It's a social series.
I just saw him on TV.
No, may God grant you a long life.
The series currently on TV is called "Blackmailing a Little Flower."
But, I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
Requires a high budget
But don't forget that the producing institution is a local one.
We need to support him.
What matters to you.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they're starting to film the series "Blackmail of Conscience."
And that a huge budget is allocated to him.
However, it was said that the series was weak.
Others said that the chain consisted of a school that taught debauchery.
It's possible they'll stop shooting.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Hello. Welcome, please have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome.
I'm Monir. I'm a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if that's okay with you.
Yes, okay, please sit for a bit, there's a meeting.
Mercury, this will allow us to use a design for the universe.
By the way, we will reach out to all the world's correspondents to get in touch with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Media Production Company
Discusses his issues in a manner that ranks it as the best output in the history of the world.
Do you believe that the one who wrote this...
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like this?
Do we have a journalist like this?
A journalist must have a sense of ethics.
They work.
Do you think they are here for *
I met His Excellency, the Minister. Do you know what he told me?
It's very tragic and its events are unusual.
The first episode is tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What do you think, Mother?
Don't worry, Mom, this is just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Also, have you seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your shows?
My son, art is art, not unusual cases that you generalize to people and society.
Mother, this can be done in fine arts, but drama is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turkish people.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We can't let our children see it.
Not that much, brother.
In worse TV series shown on television.
In fact, not anyone.
You're the one who's wrong.
For everyone, in every home.
Gather the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And find them.
Not ours.
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by here with some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How can the minister be pleased?
Okay, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote that.
I only post messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish praise messages from me, and I will mention that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You will be happy.
For this year
Well, if they had an agreement with him.
It's the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Alright, let's assume they all have an agreement with them.
I will only read the translation.
I wish they would bring back the series Extortion of Conscience.
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I hope they repeat it again.
When Minister's office called me for the first time
We are able to attend to collect the final installment of the series' funds.
They were right to call you the wizard.
Not everything
The profits were rewarding, and we took our money.
The serial is also a failure.
The writer himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm here to propose the second part of the series.
The minister believed the press stunt I invented.
He believed in the illusory success we achieved.
He is not satisfied with the series.
It means it's impossible for him to agree to the second part.
I assure you that the minister himself will request the second part.
I can only
Say "thank you"
To all people
Who worked on this serial?
And congratulate them on his success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those awards for outstanding festivals
Proves that there is
This is your opinion.
You are a genius.
I will surely win the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said, "If the readers and the press are lying to me."
Yeah, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are a wash for art.
Art wash!
I've heard about money laundering.
Not art
Illegal money
Cereals are the same thing.
What can we do with "one-two"?
What do you mean?
We signed a contract with them, they have to comply.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread in all its types and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular, and varied.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Has anyone told you about his product?
Well, actually, they just told me it was bread, but I don't know what's in it.
It's bread with a zipper.
You call it a "beetle."
Instead of slicing bread, (samon) as you call it = semolina bread.
The inventor tried to make it easier.
Genise bread
This is the secret.
You eat bread with the zipper.
These people do very strange things.
This zipper is amazing, designed in such a way that when you put it in your mouth, it dissolves.
It can be in different flavors, strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Come, Salama
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We delivered it today, sir.
Tell him oh! Forgive.
We were with your son, Nasser, yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security personnel
It's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans too.
When you took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
The people who are important in the company.
Indispensable ones
He took the bakery to the hospital.
Why are you bothering the man?
You said he can't, he's from a well-known family, he can't run after the ball and laugh at himself.
He can do what he wants.
But don't take the basic necessities.
What can I do, Mom? My team has a match and I need four players.
No more excuses.
Well, what's done is done.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
I went with him.
He told him to get dressed.
They had me standing in the goal area.
The match has started.
After that, I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was distracted.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, Nasser!
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all the bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
He missed it.
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, Abu Nasser.
Listen to what he wants to say.
Present, I will do it, just because you asked me.
Speak, what did you want to say?
Tomorrow we'll play the last match in the tournament.
Don't be angry with him, Abu Nasser, please.
Alright, guys!
Congratulations, congratulations
Okay, okay, okay, congratulations.
Mr. Nasser, I'd like to speak with you for a minute, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, we have to
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
And contact the press and journalists to come there.
No, Rashid! We'll have it at our house.
So when my dad sees the players and their success, maybe he won't cancel it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and talking to the press with them.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Picture
Keep it close to me.
Take a good picture.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's victory, the bakers, made them proud.
Full of vitality
And the effort
Loyalty to the bakery.
Sorry, Abu Nasser, we saw the team play 4-4-2.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
May God bless you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
Journalists from the League and the Cup are coming to interview you.
No, I'm not one of their gatherings.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Insha'Allah, your phone will always ring, and your pictures will be in the newspapers. You are blessed with football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He said, "Lower the price of the engines," and I said, "Okay."
Yeah, now you're famous, under every picture of you in the papers, they write 'The first player at International Bakeries'.
Were you interested in soccer?
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
You say I wasn't close to football.
Since the person next to me plays soccer, I'm close to soccer.
Being close to sports means I'm a sporty man.
We are not just international bakeries now, we have become international football.
I heard him say yesterday that he's establishing a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete from the International Bakeries, Abu Nasser.
To promote football
Before the match, tell us your predictions before you go to the theater.
The game is difficult today.
The team that controls the midfield today will be the one to *...*
Yes, God willing, we are in contact with professional players' agents to develop the International Bakery Team.
His name is Saud, listen, we need commitment.
Yeah, he wants the previous deal for the players.
It was useless.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
The Gulf is part of the world.
Of course not.
This is none of your business.
But you have to notify me when someone from the Gulf comes.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a central midfielder.
Look, these four players
Three of them cost.
Two hundred thousand dollars per player
Take them all in one bundle.
It will be six hundred thousand, I'll give them to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Beautiful, that's about African players, now, for the Brazilian player.
He's the player of the season, he alone is worth two million dollars.
They quoted me this price, but then I received a fax. I'll show it to you, it's right here. Wait, look, look, I received it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
God willing, I will examine his hind leg muscle.
How is he?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want to cheat, I hope there's no cruciate ligament.
O Father of Nasser
What is this tendinous muscle?
Butcher! Make a traditional rice and meat dish.
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players. Congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the store, the store.
Oh God, if it's His will, you have another business.
No, no, no, only the players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the jungles of Africa.
Yes, why like this?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human just like me.
A young man said, "I didn't listen to his words."
He said they were young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, it will be in your best interest later on.
And then they release it onto the field.
Come, come, come, come
Make it easy on him, he's still young.
Put it in the annex, let it grow.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your coach needs to understand.
We won 2-0, we dominated the game.
My father, he is Spain's coach.
I don't like it.
Successful coach
The game must be controlled.
And this is the reverse, the Al Wakrah road.
We should let your coach do what he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We need to stop this.
If he were an expert in soccer, he would have done corner kicks, and not attacked from the middle.
Yes, I rely on the offside trap.
Oh mother, don't give me a headache.
Kakuno must be expelled.
And he replaced it with the shinamo hababu hitawala hitawa hawawa
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Forget about Shololo Habobo, damn it.
Which line?
Implementing the plan
And forget Hololo
What was supposed to happen between the coach and the team manager.
Star of the game, star of the team
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan!
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery car, let him take a taxi.
None of your business.
Stay informed.
Do you think what my father did was fair?
The coach was fired and sent back.
What's he doing?
It's ruining the team.
Goodbye to our team.
Mama Mama
No, he's crazy. That means he said you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this boy.
I feel he is incapable of taking responsibility.
Forget the bullshit and talking about the past.
You need to go to her father and find out why your daughter is divorced.
I don't know what to say, my brother Rashid.
Why did he divorce her then?
It's not fair, Abu Abdullah. We need to know, we have a right to know, why is she divorced?
Please, don't interfere. It's none of your business.
Why, should I interfere? The man is sitting in the living room waiting to find out why his daughter is divorced?
She knows how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know my Spanish role.
Barcelona is not a lady.
This is Guardiola's team.
That means I'm going to the man who's waiting for me in the lounge.
If you go, I'll go. Fine, leave it here and let me handle it.
You have to leave and not nod your head.
It wasn't enough for her to insult Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your impudent daughter mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter isn't a Barcelona fan and doesn't suit us (like us).
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
To apologize and please her.
Damn me.
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if it doesn't make our child happy?
Oh, stop it.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not mad.
She's crazy, my son. Forget about her.
Drink your tea, my son!
Do you know, son, they are the losers.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I feel sorry for her.
Poor thing, she got divorced two days ago.
After one month of marriage
What's wrong with you, do you want me to share with him?
I don't want to be in trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know who he is.
What more do you want!
Her wealth only.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and turn into an apartment hotel?
Those in Mansoura.
Belonging to his father, and when our son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If I can.
Talk to her brother.
Listen well.
The millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity only comes once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain to spend every summer there.
Okay, and the Barcelona story?
The girl's family might have spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect that.
And do not mock the team.
Assuming this story is true.
God bless you, they called his father Abu Borgain because he has two towers on the corniche.
Designed it in a strange way like twisted ropes.
When people see them from a distance, they think it's one tower.
What do you think? All the luck is on your side.
Hello
God bless you. Come on, take something, everything.
Thank you, my love.
But tell me, my dear, my son Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry, O my eye's light, Umm Abdullah.
If I searched the entire Gulf Cooperation Council, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
Are you done, sir? Is there anything else?
Yes, the family will contact you.
"Figure out their needs for the wedding, prepare the check, and I'll sign it."
In the name of God, God willing, in the name of God, God willing, with your permission, Your Excellency.
Abdullah is divorced again!
I wish the children were from you and the wealth from him.
God bless you, auntie!
You wear it because of the cold.
Yes, but I don't know where my mom booked us.
Where did you book for us, Mother?
Mom says she booked us for Malaysia.
What's up in Malaysia, cool.
Have a safe trip.
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of anyone coming back from their honeymoon crying?
What's wrong, my daughter? Tell me.
Tell me what happened, my daughter!
Mom, she's very arrogant.
Why like this?
She's arrogant, forget about her.
I did the right thing when I fired her.
I feel sorry for her.
This is her mother.
Why is she upset?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where are we going?
Complete
Mom says she booked us for the Maldives.
Okay, okay! The Maldives girl is pretty too.
She also beats you up.
I thought you would come back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is why he took the kids.
Come! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you sad, light of my eye?
Shut up! May God give you health, you're telling me about my son's face.
Oh, my son! Why are you sad?
When I see the shells, I'll be depressed.
Oh, you who bother me, die (like) Oh! My child
Forget about her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
Be quiet, and I know my son, anything small bothers him, why should he live upset!
Oh my son, call her and divorce her.
"God curse him."
%pw Tell her three times.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't reply, there are two more times.
Absolute, absolute.
Very tense.
Oh my son! Go, my dear, rest and don't worry, there are many girls, as they say, go on, my son.
Oh, problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
I'm saying what, mother? He has divorced me, he told you, "You are divorced, divorced."
Why did he divorce you? He's rude.
Now, if a woman goes to a disco, what will she do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's happening! The world has turned upside down!
You'll see, I'll go to his house and humiliate him, and he won't even know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced from Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
As if you can taste the bitterness in your mouth right now for your daughter, and you're discouraged.
And they did nothing.
"If she didn't bring you the apple peeled, divorce her."
You are allowed to release them as you wish.
She is still married to a man.
Is this suitable for you, let it go to hell!
And you feel the same thing you did to others.
What you do not accept for yourselves.
Don't accept it for people.
Do you know who owned the land this mall is on?
In a strategic location?
"Leave it to God."
And also at a low price.
Out of service.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office the week before, and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm out of the office and the problem is I need to get Abu Sakr's approval, I need to.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, may God protect you, is the office, not the home.
Do you eat too?
What would make this jar full of falcons?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahd.
Do you know him?
As far as I know, I only see him on TV, and you told me that you meet him during the pilgrimage.
But we know each other very well.
Get out of your grandfather's house.
God guides us and you, I came quickly, at least ask about the reason for this celebration.
There's no occasion for this, God guide us and guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he holds fifty feasts.
I suggest, Your Highness, that you be put in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the world's top party maker.
By the way, who is this brother with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
It is an honor, Your Excellency.
Oh God! Abu Flah
You say Abu Sakr throws a feast every day.
This is what we see.
But oh! Abu Falah's feast tonight is a special occasion.
Today, may God protect you, your son Falcon.
God willing, you deserve it, O honor, with blessings.
He's here, hello son!
Peace be upon you
For what?
On this occasion, my son Saqr needs to go to the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I waited a year and a half to get approval.
I was out of work.
But when I reached him.
And I give him money.
May God guide us, O Abu Sa'd.
Things won't work this way.
I told him "okay."
He needs to visit the exhibition and choose the car he likes.
We'll buy him three.
Take him with you!
They took me to him.
You told me you met him last year.
Today, his youngest son is Shahin.
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
He passed by and congratulated him.
He deserves to be well, sir.
Shahin Oh! Abu Sakkar.
God bless you, thank you all.
Praise be to God that Shaheen is well, Your Highness.
God bless you
By the way, who are you?
Your Excellency
You didn't introduce yourself to me.
I can't lie to you (like that).
Your happiness, I was with you on the Umrah last year.
And I remember you bought a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It is an honor to meet you.
So, Saker, are you still undecided about entering the field of trade, or have you made up your mind?
I'm tired of him.
Why, my son Falcon, trade is beautiful.
You need to start, open an office, and then see.
Abu Sakr
Your happiness, please say yes.
For what?
I have a gift, a falcon.
Full floor
Even if business loves you and comes your way, you'll say no.
Who has everything available today like you? Since you got the license, everything comes easily, a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdel Aziz was telling your father that if he's keen to join the business, I'd allow him to be my partner with a 50% share.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Oh mother, don't make me do something I don't like.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
What an opportunity, my son, for whoever can start a project at this time without capital!
Your only capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, man! This is your chance in life.
Hozur prepared lunch quickly.
He also reached for the pickles and pepper.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
This is the thing I was excited to see. Do you know what he told me today?
My mother told me she wants to expand her investments.
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And I ask Allah to protect him from the eyes of the envious.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, "Your son has started work now."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
It seems
I think, God knows best, they haven't opened it yet.
Yes, the one in the northern area of our office, what's wrong with it?
No, but I love him.
Thank you, and God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God
God bless you all.
There's no need to regret now.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of suffering and hard work to prepare the supermarket.
What's the problem! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent me his secretary, whose name is Samer.
He told me this is Saqr, son of Abu Saqr, that he wants to be your partner instead of taking the store from you.
Does he also want to be your partner?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
You started talking to him, right?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
Less talk, more action!
Why did you tell him you had an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on this sign? What name was written on the sign?
It's written on the neighborhood bakery.
No, I want a different name.
Peace be upon you too.
So, how's work going for you?
God willing, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we will finish the drawings for the workers' accommodation for the Future Company.
No, no, Mr. Saqr, she is my wife Elsa. Let me introduce you to Mr. Saqr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, one person says he wants to work in business, he has some money and wants to invest it.
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, or study of economics, or even business.
A limit like this limit
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and fail.
Did you hear, Oh! Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what those two parrots are saying?
What is this?
You have my son, Falcon.
See it.
See him today.
Your happiness, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son is a falcon, whatever God wills, and I don't want to change him, except for the better.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
I scared him, I have a falcon that builds itself.
Once he gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
And whatever Allah wills, I see it now.
Ah! Falcon, we are talking about ordinary people.
One of them is a falcon, and that's what Abu Nasser did with him. He took him and put him on the road.
Saquar has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
We need to ask: Who is his father?
I swear I'm amazed.
As God wills
"Gulf Money Magazine in the Economic Referendum"
Please come in.
Hello, welcome Salem.
What's wrong?
I swear, I don't know what to say, Salem.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my parents.
And they said to him
Poor him, he couldn't bear it.
As you can see
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office and the fax was in his hand.
He rendered him many services.
As the saying goes, "I taught him archery, and when he became strong, he shot me with an arrow."
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, Salim.
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man who gives to the poor without letting his left hand know what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization are distributed to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I also want you to explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at the Saqr Association is to achieve solidarity in this homeland.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Last but not least, we are now also supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty-two riyals.
We won't be late.
I'll come to you right away.
Who is this beloved one?
This is Khalid and his wife, they are staying at the hotel tonight.
Yes, anywhere, anywhere I am with you, I am happy.
My love, (may God keep you for me) always.
Oh, my beloved!
This isn't fair. This is my source of income.
This is the bakery.
And you take money for your own benefit.
Five riyals for falafel, three riyals for hot bread.
Two chickpeas
Five broad beans, perfect, perfect.
Cook six broad beans!
Come on, divers!
The captain is here and brought breakfast.
Needs men.
Excuse me, sir!
What next?
No, what I'm asking you for is I want to hear the ring of "yes" in my ear.
Hello Nora
Anoud is mad at you.
Can I bear your anger?
What's the problem?
Why are you upset?
Noura chose a simple and quiet dress.
Don't say Anoud will get upset.
Good heavens, these Lebanese speak excellently.
And you should not speak to him much.
Me too, I'm jealous of her.
The best dress for the most beautiful Nora.
He flirts with her by calling her Nora.
How long does it take for your blood to boil?
I paid twenty thousand and there will be twenty thousand riyals left.
"Hopefully you will be compensated (like) Congratulations!"
God be with you
Hello, you are Um Saleh's husband.
Hello Fadi, it seems you're busy, I don't want to take up your time.
I am at your service.
Hello, hello.
Did you receive my text message yesterday?
I got it, ya! You idiot.
Did you like the joke?
Did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them. Show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
Frankly, your taste is better.
They'll leave us, and envy will start working.
He knows my project is good and has started generating income.
They say he will do a project like mine.
Design and Sewing Boutique
Women's clothing
This is Abu Nasser who has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
It will harm his relative.
That's how it is these days.
Yes, yes, my cousin.
Do you know that I was sleeping and they woke me up saying your cousin wants you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
I hope so.
You don't have any plans for any project, for example, like, like
Are you coming to find a partner or something?
I heard you were a designer, so I thought I should visit you.
Welcome
If you need more, we've got it.
Praise be to God, the work is going well.
What should I do, Abu Saleh?
But we're too late, they hired him last week.
Yes, they did.
Okay, God willing, goodbye.
So it is.
Are you sure?
With haute couture and did you know the great tragedy!
What is it?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You are jealous! (Ad) You are hateful!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone,
You must know.
Your heart must be open to your cousin.
I'm not asking you.
You deny, lie, and laugh at me, and you said to me, "I, ..."
I wanted to hide my work.
To take that is the shop next door, you want to disrupt my work.
But they didn't say come and be like a pain in the neck next to wisdom teeth, you're making me crazy.
This is envy and hatred. By God, I'll slap you. It's hatred, leave it alone.
Come on, are you relatives or what?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave it to me, I'll handle it, you guy! Oh! You, with your voice that sounds like water.
I'll hit you just as you hit me by stealing my part.
Come on, people!
Just say "peace be upon him," people.
I swear, I swear, you didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why the Lebanese in particular?
They talk to him, joke, laugh, and feel very comfortable.
That's why Abu Saleh brought a Lebanese person.
He started saying sweet words to me and convincing me.
Amaze me, amaze me with your talk.
Convince me and guide me to pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
And make money.
A Lebanese designer arrived.
Can I meet with the gentleman? You told me yesterday that it was difficult, and today it's difficult as well?
Yes, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's wrong?
No, I don't know. What's wrong with you?
Abu Saleh was mentally exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer like him.
For two weeks, the store's sales have been declining.
This is the problem here in Qatar; no Qatari will open a shop unless another Qatari comes along and starts the same project, opening an identical shop right next to him. Can I go in?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now and they're thinking of a solution.
What are you doing now?
We're sitting as if we've eaten poison.
If we keep like this, I think we won't even be able to pay the rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
This means we'll be clearing the way for them.
Okay, thank you, and what is the discount amount?
Impossible, why don't you give an evening dress for free with every wedding dress?
Impossible, let's go.
What's up? What happened? We're going to the store next to you; today they put up an ad with every wedding dress, two free evening headscarves, and also a 25% discount.
Okay, let's go, let's go.
And now wait two weeks, they will announce the same advertisement, buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I think the same thing too, if we leave them, they will destroy us.
Don't bother.
What did he do next?
It's definitely a challenge.
Of course, it's a challenge.
Bravo, he deserves it, this troublemaker, he doesn't want anyone to earn their livelihood.
If it happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days. I'll close his shop.
Excellent work.
Wait, wait, hold the line, hold the line, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's the matter?
Saad says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit there, he says he doesn't know where the bad smell comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, it's impossible.
Its smell lingers in the shop for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He is cutting the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now, are we going to sign an undertaking or start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
I will take him out of this life.
Oh Abu Nasser, something strange has happened. No one comes to our neighborhood.
Abu Nasser, lock up, lock up, a customer is coming, I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He lies in his bed groaning.
He says it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and I need the installments.
Debts piled up on him because of his despicable cousin.
What happened to him this time?
Poor guy, if they accidentally come across Saad the designer, they scream at him and run away.
Asleep! Poor thing, he's never slept, his eyes are open and he's staring at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saud is at the shop.
He put him under a spell, I don't know what he did to him.
When women see it, they are afraid of it.
I don't know, what made him become like this!
Let me lose, let me lose.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
I have no evidence against him to be able to sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forget about him, he deserves it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you cast on him, turning his designer into a monster that women are afraid to see.
Spread a rumor.
Mo kwais oh! Ya nas, qululhu inna farīq al-tashīir mahdūjukum bi-shakl ʿājil.
Oh people, may God bless you, may God protect you, tell him they need you quickly, quickly.
I swear they'll raise my blood pressure, kill me, paralyze me. This isn't fair, Mr. Abdullah.
Don't worry, my dear Ahmed, don't get angry. You have heart problems, it's not good for you, man!
I swear I've called him several times, my ear hurts, but he's no good. This increase is driving me crazy, driving me crazy.
You don't do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'm telling you a lot.
Episode twenty-five, scene sixteen, Ahmed let's finish.
So I stopped filming because there wasn't one more person showing up.
What productivity?
I have nothing to do with this, brother Abdullah. Why is he shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout at you,
What happened, Abdullah?
One more late and they're in trouble.
Ah! Ahmed, I need no one, my dear.
Look for someone of high standing who can convince people that he can truly become a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in and wait, your request will be ready in half an hour.
Not just anyone, oh! Ala'a, not just anyone, I was just clarifying for him.
Present, I can handle two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible and you are the production manager, you are in charge.
What are they going to do now?
They'll do everything, see the manager is nervous and the chaos, but they'll act.
He needs someone with specific qualifications. Where can I find him now?
Are you serious?
Didn't you hear what the director said?
I know someone, God help you with him, and I hope he's suitable.
%PW Saud Al-Bandaq !
Saud Kanz! I remember him as Saud Bokthorn.
Yes, when he was young, they called him Saud al-Batool, and when he grew up, they started calling him Kanz.
Why the cans?
I'll tell you why. Poor guy, he used to wander the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilo.
My rich and honorable brother, it is not discouraging.
His appearance is suitable, as far as I remember, he is fat and chubby, not tall and not thin.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Insha'Allah, but you have to do his makeup nicely, and I guarantee he will be suitable and he also has a sense of humor.
Okay, what are you waiting for, call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Omar with me and I'll bring him back.
Where is Saud's house?
What's he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saudi boxes
We don't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Kansa.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to someone named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Yes, that's correct.
But this isn't Saudi cans.
This is Saud's laptop.
Exactly that, but it evolves over time because laptops are like cans.
He is tall, fat, and a bit tanned.
He canceled the cans and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on! Oh! Man
He went to the vegetable market to buy it for me. Am I a goat? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one. Where is the other jotara? Where is it?
Eid
This is what I'm looking for.
Vicks Vaporub and AXE brand.
His son, who is a bit curly before he goes out, is cute.
But these days, I feel worse.
Oh Mother, may God guide us, since yesterday I've been insisting that you go to the emergency room, but you refused.
Yes, Mom, they said they would pay me.
Alhamdulillah, you're now employed instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
You're going to fight with her, you're going to get angry and you're going to lose control.
You sit and move slowly, and the camera with you, will move beside you.
Yes. Jafar! Yes.
Whose laptop is it?
Any Aboud, this is a very well-known actor, the brilliant Abdullah.
This is for you, for me he is your %pw son, Aboud how are you?
How are you, O slave?
Act yourself, you need to act a little in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, stay calm, stay calm.
I love acting, and I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
It's not as you know, my brother.
She is very sick, she knows she didn't sleep last night Oh! My brother!
Asthma, my brother, may God heal you.
May God heal her.
Your life is just a bowl of cherries.
Ah! Oh, my lord! Ah! Oh, my lord!
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He is a director, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he says, you have no point.
What's his mother's name?
On your face, what do you think?
Did you hear what she said about you?
She says you're stupid, you should be more rational.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million to fix my damaged car tires.
Give him three million to bring me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you talk like that.
Because I am fasting at the request of some people.
See Mr. Ghafel, our region's production, high-level actors.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Okay, I'll help you. I have no senses, right?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is just a bowl of cherries.
Take the man to the makeup room, do his makeup, and I'll tell Salman to bring you the costume and come to you.
Come on, come on, come on, this is nice.
Okay, okay.
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
All that matters to you, is there anyone who can take me?
To give you a lift! No problem, I'll have our driver give you a lift. Alright, thank you, brother. Thank you, thank you, wait.
Okay, call your friend, the extra one, call him.
Oh God! People are calling Saud from the makeup room laptop.
Let him brush my teeth later.
It's already written in front of me.
Okay, let's review.
This means I!
I didn't expect this from you.
We'll fight, for what!
We will fight for our rights.
Ah, wait.
And you need to know who you're talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
Divorce her and be done with it.
And we don't marry the daughter of a thief.
Whatever you need, what do you think?
He's cleaning it, but later. The most important thing is that you get ready because you're going to the changing room to change your clothes, and we're ready to shoot.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
People, the shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why this?
I don't need tea, brother. I'm full and my stomach is bloated from all the tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour. How much longer do I have to wait?
%PW You haven't seen anything, it's very common.
May God give you health and strength.
They are fast.
Thank you, Your Highness. May God protect you.
Send my regards to your people.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Present, Your Honor %PW.
That was fun, wasn't it?
Who's like you, they greet you and still kiss your nose.
The first time someone patted my nose.
How do they accept them on their noses?
This is a problem.
His nose is like an ice cream stick, it hurts your lips. That was funny, that was funny.
I didn't laugh!
There's no need to mention it.
Can I be an actor?
Something's wrong. What's with your voice?
Oh my son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
See it for yourself, man.
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
What happened, my son!
Peace be upon you, what's wrong with you, Your Highness?
Vinegar, vinegar, vinegar, vinegar
Don't bother, God willing it will be, come on! Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
Yes, oh! Dr. Hani, what happened?
Let Honor rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is a mother to all, may God willing, she will be fine.
Hello, Your Highness, hello.
Shut up or I'll slap you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, sir!
How are you, sir?
May God curse you.
Yes, Your Highness.
Hello, sir. Please have a seat.
God bless you.
With this ugly face (like).
Go with him, Professor Rashid.
I swear, if I didn't do something for you, tell me and you'll see what I'll do to him.
Oh friend! Can I quickly find a doctor, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, my friend?
Oh my son, quickly, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, I haven't found anyone like them, they are kind and accept anything.
Unlike female citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Okay, then look for a wife in the hospital.
I love her.
But oh! Brother, she's ignoring me.
Okay, try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number with good intentions.
There's nothing, there's nothing wrong.
Act yourself.
Get out, get out, if you don't leave, I'll call security to teach you a lesson.
No, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
Please help me.
No, thank you.
You can take her and go to the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Falih Al-Marzouz.
You're going to marry him, which means you're going to marry him.
No, no, I need the car, the clothes, and also the car, I'll rent it from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Let's go.
What is this %PW in Al-Muraزوoع!
Welcome, welcome, you are very welcome.
The apple of his eye signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were amazed at what I did for them; it was a very elegant and unique party.
One regular and one diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom, I promised my friends I'd see them tomorrow at work.
Will you take this to them!
Ah, what's wrong?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He's going to take this to his friends, for the scandal.
Don't even think about taking it, you'll make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, and tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Yeah, but I promised them now.
I need to take him tomorrow.
No problem, we're still open. Go and change your clothes so we can find something that pleases everyone.
What's wrong! Let's go.
Its prices are reasonable and its quality is excellent.
Above average, not the best!
Of course, there's premium chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for something more affordable.
It's too expensive, why are you looking for the most expensive one?
This is unbelievable, check out this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always requested in the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, there's a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come here, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother.
What's the occasion, man?
No, Saleh Abdulqader, the one in accounting.
By the blessing of God, he deserves it, give me another one.
And quickly bring the coffee.
Aunt, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, dear, I was at their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Do you believe that, sister!
Did you hear your aunt's words?
That's why I want to throw you an unparalleled wedding.
No time, you only have a month and a half.
I'm organizing everything.
But what makes me do something.
You're not living in society; don't you see how people put everything they have into their weddings?
And you saw for yourself.
When I bought something sweet, I saw how they praised you and your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's amazing and wonderful?
Right, but how much did we pay?
The money we spent on chocolate could buy four sheep for the wedding.
Please don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and be done with it.
This means they will accept whatever we choose.
Yeah, your taste is really bad.
What's your opinion about this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was nice!
What do you think about this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone has thought of creating a platform similar to a computer mouse.
Please, one minute.
Look, talk about everything except the stage and the arrangements. This is the place where women who have nothing else stay, just for the fun of it, but keep quiet.
The men are waiting for us.
We'll go to the mouse stage.
This is a very strange phase.
Latest model in 2011
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit on the side, all this is for your own good.
So you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you'll have to pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, you'll pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
We're ready when you are.
You're not the first one to get married.
What do you think, will you get married in the Comoros? That's how things are done in our country.
We're still just at the beginning.
If you don't have a platform, where do you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit and lie to us; in fact, they are con artists.
What's wrong with you now?
Are you angry and upset?
If you want to get married, fine.
I'll call the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh is going through very difficult circumstances.
He doesn't want to get married? He can't afford the wedding expenses? That's fine with me. Do you want me to talk to her? I'm serious, I'll talk to her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put them on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
Also the Middle East!
Put it on the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, finished then.
But Samir, I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
You know people's discussions.
Okay, they're reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
A problem we can't afford is about to start.
God help you, Saleh.
But for heaven's sake, you should have tried to sort things out.
For me, praise be to God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say the wedding will only cost you two thousand dollars and enjoy.
God bless you, dear.
God willing, his wedding is next month.
You just need to specify the number of cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are appropriate, that's good. The main thing is that people know they are invited, where and when, and that's it.
You only care about him, you don't care what people will say.
People know the wedding standard from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the girls will say.
Look at their marriage; if these are their invitations, they didn't see the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say that, we'll order it online.
It has a cloth cover, is made of panda skin, and has a silver sheen.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't be the topic of ladies' conversations, we're asking for invitations, I mean, we're asking for invitations!
I feel sorry for him, man.
I seek refuge in God from him; of course, his family pressured him a lot.
Dude, he's stealing money from everyone.
What do you mean, he even sold his car.
He looks twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, my brother, poor thing, I don't know when we will evolve.
Please close the door.
Sorry, brother!
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding within your budget?
What do you mean by "within my budget"?
Why, do I live alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the disease of appearances, boasting and showing off.
Forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live there.
Once, I caught the bride's mother's eye.
Her words were attacked (figuratively).
Put your trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if I decided, my brother, to get married,
I'm considering marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
He says your country!
We decided to bring a DJ for the songs.
But because Umm Nasser invited a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so upset?
It seems you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
Earlier, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I understood, now you've changed your mind.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, Mom just stops him.
I don't care about you and him.
I am no less than people.
Don't laugh at us.
Please, Mom, enough. My brother spent all he had and took money from everyone.
Please be quiet.
My mom has new demands for the wedding and my brother told me he doesn't have money, so I screamed at him and he told me to cancel it, I don't want to get married.
Where is she now?
She's inside and they're administering first aid to her.
He said she was much better now and they would find her a room in the hospital.
What a scandal!
Rest, my sister!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you a sleeping injection.
How can I rest when he wants to laugh at us for good and evil.
I was telling him to bring Abdullah Ruischad, and he told me he didn't have any money.
I'm sorry about your mother.
Be anxious about her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her that I will do what you want.
I'll bring you Abdullah Ruishad.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he won't help me.
It's not fair, I couldn't find anyone but Abu Youssef.
What's wrong?
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he was an old man, and moreover, he was disciplined and honest.
Do you want my opinion? If you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
This is because of the damn crisis she's going through and she wants to ask Abu Youssef for some money, of course from the ministry's funds.
Only God knows when He will bring it back to Him.
And when the auditors came and asked him about the money,
Of course, there could be a problem.
No one knows him, but he knows how to deal with her.
It's up to you, the man is in his office and you must be responsible if anything happens to him.
I've been stealing lately!
My uncle doesn't call it stealing.
On the first floor
In it, there is a white box wrapped in blue tape with a circle containing a picture of a dove's wing; bring it, bring it.
"It's me, Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me. If I don't have any problems, ..."
I'll pay it all back.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And you came in my final days.
Corrupt me, Thursday!
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to what I'm telling you, if it was someone else, they would have been slapped or something bad would have happened to them, oh! oh! oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
All the methods I've tried don't work, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm drowning.
I can't back out of the marriage.
And you know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the other one, the tablet that's causing chaos, the tablet that's causing chaos.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Youssef, the stairs are full of discs, which one do you need?
The can with the picture of a man in a state of panic.
We booked only two rooms for makeup and hair styling for us exclusively.
And we'll be there from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Ruishad and his band.
You'll see, dear.
No, I won't tell you.
It'll be the hit of the season.
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Mom, mom,
Goodbye
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to recite the Mu'awwadhatain when you enter the hall.
The women here have an evil eye.
I told you before that it's amazing.
The best gram ever, God bless you, I don't want to change you.
Mum mum, the police are knocking at the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It's not fair, today is my wedding day.
The people who came took the test.
And now I'm in prison, oh my God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But that's not fair if it happens!
The company offered a contract worth three million, two million of which is just for materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but the corruption doesn't go this far.
It seems you don't live in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
Why didn't our president object? They say he was in on it!
I don't know about him, truly I don't know.
Where is the morality?
Righteousness has become wrong and wrong has become righteousness!
Oh Saad! Are you sure the minister has dismissed him? Oh people, what has happened to the world?
I just fired him!
What next?
It is owned by the minister's sister.
This girl is in a relationship with the minister.
What a strange world (proverb).
What's wrong with you, guys? Don't you know who she is?
This is the new employee whom the minister hired instead of the unfortunate Uthman.
Come on, come on, come on.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Oppose the minister!
Are you crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
There he is, standing by the elevator.
This is the reward for loyalty and honesty, my brother Saleh.
I wish we could do something for you, brother!
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see incredible things.
I'm at your service.
I want you to stop by the supermarket after work and get me some vegetables for the salad.
Try, take care.
Who will take my sister home?
She was sitting in the front, laughing and chatting. Who was she?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem if he drops me off at home? There's no problem.
Oh my God, how old-fashioned you look!
What are you saying?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You are old-fashioned.
There is old and new right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
International variables are changing so rapidly that they are harmonizing the world, and no one can keep up with them.
The more I live, the more I see!
Don't blame me, Manira; it's against my principles to be tense and angry.
This is one of the things he sees in his day.
Tell her he's sorry.
Life isn't going the right way.
Don't be sad, come and eat lunch.
Let me sleep so I can rest.
The president is not angry with you.
Is the president not angry?
No, he's not angry, go wash your face and eat lunch.
All right, dear.
I'm very excited to meet you on my first day of work.
It is an honor, Your Excellency.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the job.
However, at the same time, it is very important.
To recall some of the values and principles you operate by
In the public interest.
This is what honor should be.
We all have to work.
The division is absolutely necessary, sir.
To be thieves
Thank you all.
What I want to say after this.
And he warned you from the very first day I started work.
Among you, there is one employee.
Who is truthful, faithful, devoted, and who is like these bad things,
Just a suspicion.
He is a devoted employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, things will be as you like, my honor.
Praise be to God, we're all thieves.
As you wish, my lord, I'll say it in front of and behind my colleagues.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Highness.
Khaled, you were highly praised, may God bless you.
Present, Your Honor.
Sir, you know how to choose.
"May God guide you both."
Why did you let the devil control you?
You should thank God that it was only about honesty.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Shut up, girl.
No, no, I'll never do it again.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Stop her.
This means he has become honest.
It is very unfortunate to say that your father is truthful.
Is this the costume!
Your whole body is covered.
What are people seeing?
And God willing, you are looking for a job, no one will hire you like this.
Is there a respectable lady who covers her body and attractiveness?
She covers her chest, wearing it up to here, and chokes herself.
I'm tired of her, boy.
And I bought her a top and pants that show her midriff above her navel.
But it's a hopeless case, she doesn't want to be on the right track.
I'm telling you, hurry!
You'll only blame yourself.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us is just looking for the right man for his daughter these days.
Let me tell you, O Rashid, my son.
He is a very good man.
He never stops drinking (proverb).
He's drunk 24/7.
Drunk, intoxicated, and heavy all day.
And do not ask about boasting.
He is well-bred.
And let me tell you he's a hypocrite too.
And how about theft?
This is what I expect from you, and how are the medications?
Clear, done. I'll give you five riyals if you can find his pupil, I'll make a contest out of it.
By the way, Abu Sara, we just came to ask for her hand.
You know about staying up late and taking walks.
We know she came from a good family.
With Ibn Mubarak, with blessing, thus life goes on, with blessing.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Okay, come on.
Goodbye, farewell.
Okay, call your father to come pick you up.
Why do I need to call him?
So he can come and get you.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, standing with a blonde girl.
Indeed, your father walks straight, and he enjoys it.
Hello, my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yes, that's correct.
You've confused me, my daughter.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in two thousand and ninety, after signing a comprehensive peace treaty with the State of Israel.
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest were the claims made by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially Article Two, Paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails daily.
Let's move on to the crucial meeting.
Mr. Chip
When Israel agrees to establish the State of Palestine,
Oh man! What are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation. Just leave me alone!
Please!
Sorry, Mr. Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
He has fully committed to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find something hard, like a stone or plastic, as a commitment.
Dude, even our houses.
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, make wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very important point and I would like to vote on it because nail growth is a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I had a very strange dream.
So that you can control the students.
I'm tired of his talk.
This is the fourth school you will start working at tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys follow him and tear his clothes, and he does nothing.
How many times has he come to me without a shirt?
The manager told me.
Rashid is kind, and we don't want to expel him.
The children throw chalk at him.
And they drag him out of his right to rest in front of everyone.
They said that this teacher is very indecisive and will ruin everything.
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the story with ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop her.
By the way, your new boss who you start working with tomorrow called me.
Still, it's okay, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The age of kindness and weakness is over.
Oh uncle! Oh Abdullah!
You'll see Rashid differently.
And I don't need to remind you of the important educational quote,
You are a graduate of education, and so am I.
And we all know the quote,
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will meet Mr. Rashid the powerful.
And if someone makes a mistake,
He's going to face a problem.
When you start talking, he said, just be quiet.
You'll see what I'll tell him.
Which one of you mocked me and told me to just shut up? Which one?
You're the one who told me to just shut up!
No, not me.
It's you next to you!
Go to the principal.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, you hear me!
What do you think of my anxiety?
It's not just supposed to be like your first day, it's supposed to be like this all year round.
Be aware of the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
While I explain or speak.
Do you know what he's doing?
It means tense, do you know what tense means?
Means tense.
Did you hear what I'm telling you or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the classroom.
Go to the manager.
Take your stuff and get out now!
Take your stuff.
What matters to me.
It's clear that he's still looking for it.
No, sir, we didn't see it.
By the way, strawberry ice cream is really delicious if it has strawberries inside.
Dear Abdurrahman
Everyone makes mistakes, and so does man.
I'm just joking, my son.
But most importantly, your father doesn't know the story!
I don't want that, I want chocolate in my bag.
Okay, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your service.
He says he's happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich kid and a regular kid.
Bad luck, how does bad luck look green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before them all, one juice and one chip.
I took it before all of them, I bothered them. My friend Abdulrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and take the PlayStation disc from him.
What can we learn from this story?
That man
He must have morals.
This is the PlayStation device, and he also told me to bring the PlayStation once.
Alright, do you want something else, my friend Abdurrahman, my friend?
Currently, nothing.
We learn for the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted to graduate school.
I thought I should submit the event file before I travel.
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdurrahman told me, and I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me what time!
As long as his father came back and didn't say anything to him, praise be to God for your assurance and peace of mind.
Let me say that I didn't take it this afternoon and he got upset, told his father, "No, no, no, it's a disaster, no, no."
Hello, my friend Abdulrahman
God helps you.
What are you doing? This is an order.
Do you love him, do you love him like this?
Today, children, we're having a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Thank you.
I need water.
What did you ask? You didn't ask anything. I'm at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How do you ask for water from the teacher?
A teacher brings water to a student, are you his tea servant? This incident won't go unnoticed, I'm writing it in the report.
And you're laughing too, laughing at me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, do you hear me or not?
Is this enough for a number of?
Okay, how many cars is this for?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, beautiful, excellent.
What is he doing?
As you can see, he will park his car in front of our houses at the expense of our convenience.
Don't tell me about the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Alright, you broke the table.
Don't get tense, brother!
Why like this?
Are you different? (Example)
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything, brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not threatening you, brother!
What do you mean there's nothing and I want to make things easy for you?
What are you saying?
Instead of, what do they call it?
It seems you want that.
You want this, go ahead.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
It's not him who loves, this isn't fair!
What the neighborhood has
We came to Uncle Naif to discuss, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid who wants to do what he wants in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Alright people, be quiet and let's hear what Uncle Abu Naif has to say.
Now, this good-for-nothing loser is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If you don't slap him in the face, he won't keep the scarf he's wearing on.
The game is played by its players (proverb).
Is this acceptable?
%Pw Goodbye.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Do you know he now has a jewelry store!
That's why I see you wearing all these rings and necklaces here.
God will compensate us.
Just walk, you'll stay in the heat?
How true it is that the naive and poor Rashid has become like this.
Became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
There's no need to mention it.
Don't mention it, Abdullah!
I'll tell you the secret.
The teacher has come, the teacher has come.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Yes, dear, I know who he is.
Here I tell you, we won't have a good opportunity like this.
I, am looking for a job! This is funny, I swear this is funny.
No, bro, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Send him my regards.
Your mother sends you her greetings. May God protect you, I will tell her that he sends his greetings.
Okay, goodbye dear, in God's care.
What more do you want, your brother is going to be a minister, just believe it, son!
Oh Mother! We work, we work at a high level.
But, my son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
He just gives it to you like that.
Everything is fine, right?
Perfect! This is automatic, without any doubt.
"I beg you, please fulfill my dream."
Before your dream, my dream.
He is building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
It seems your friend is annoyed.
It doesn't look like that, brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
Do you believe that he stood up, took the phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh?
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm a hundred million percent sure that Abu Sultan harbors a grudge against him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh wasn't good.
No, Abu Sultan wouldn't do that unless he's planning to do something else.
Really, to this extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh my son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in the cafes happen in the country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that women are starting to talk about her, and don't mention Latuff, the dish collector. She spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I am shocked, I will collapse.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
Mind your own business.
Manira, I'm working on a low flame.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane to catch.
Allowing them to fire him,
Yes, plan.
He needs to trust me first.
They told me we appoint him as a minister because he was appointed two months before I was.
Because I'm quite sure he'll be fired from his job.
Magic may be undone.
What is it?
What's this again?
And at every event he attends, the photographer takes a few pictures of him until his photo becomes very prevalent in the newspaper.
It rots until it floats to the surface.
Are you sure?
Just wait. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, sir.
Of course, Your Highness.
And he said to me,
Did you thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The men are outside, go see them.
Don't be foolish; people want to elevate your status, and you want to humiliate yourself.
Only the minister, please, please.
No, no, no, don't take my picture, no. Just His Excellency the Minister, a photo, a photo, Your Excellency.
Take one more.
Oh brother! I really love your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, he has it too.
Present, I hear you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look at the size of his picture with the groom.
Say, "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is a social activist. Okay, okay, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is present everywhere (like).
They are jealous, they envy you. Only the fruitful tree is stoned. (Proverb)
Take me to the market!
Aren't you ready?
Peace be upon you
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty
For this famous person,
Are you at home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is getting worse.
I'm tired, I swear I'm tired. It's been a month and I'm still walking with him.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
May I say something?
Oh woman, I just want him to take me.
I started to love him.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is anxious, and he seems to love this story.
I'll send my brother Saad to you.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants an ant to disappear, He gives it wings.
Hello, sir, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Wedding ceremony?
No problem, don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can check with the hotel behind us.
Ah, in the hotel behind you, right?
Is it possible for me to leave you in the car while I go into the hotel to inquire?
Come on, come on, come on, and take your time. Go and ask, come on.
God helps everyone.
Does this minister allow us to sleep or rest?
This means he didn't find a party, a wedding, or any problem to ignite for him.
He took him to the Sixteen Thousand Hotel and couldn't find anything for him. His luck is as bad as his face.
Just shut up, hello.
I didn't find his birthday, or...
Go, you might make it for the second half!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He never gets tired, my brother.
Man, the newspaper editor says that the first thing is to prepare his picture, and then I prepare the newspaper.
She said my children participated in a contest featuring a picture of your husband, the minister.
One asks the other, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You have to come to the cafe and listen to the comments every day about his picture in the newspaper. They say it's an endless saga.
Wow, his death is very near.
As they say, when God wants the butterfly to die, it approaches the light.
People are leaving you and greeting him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
No problem, who is he?
You ruined my reputation.
God bless you and bless her.
She said that we all got married except for poor Amal; she's the only one among us who didn't get married.
This is my fate.
It's not my fate to get married.
And forget about marriage.
God is sufficient for whoever was behind it.
Do you see those spoiled brats sitting over there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the person playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father passed away, I mean, he was the one who killed him.
You saw it, it grew, right?
We can't leave it up to the maid.
Go and make some tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom. But she doesn't just have one maid, she has two for herself.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere. Khalud is my son, not yours.
Your only problem is Khadoud and the maids and the maids and Khadoud.
Mom, this isn't good. Khulud is always with the maid, twenty-four hours a day, and she doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a bit, if I don't tell my parents about you.
Let me tell you something, what's the problem with Khulood?
Saoud says that Khulood wears makeup and acts like a girl. What's going on? What's going on?
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God! Oh! Saud.
Khulud is putting makeup on her face! It's just a little bit of makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small point, barely visible.
He is kind, good, and quiet.
I will scold him, Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Now, when you grow up, tell me what you want to be?
And you, my beloved Khalid, my dear Saad, will be in an office, what do you want to become?
This year, we're going to London just like last year.
Yes, call the one who is vibrating in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susn, Khulud, and Fahad.
And say hello to Samoura.
"I seek forgiveness from Allah"
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build on the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow, oh! Amal, I want to open my eyes and be told that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells really strange.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
And if God wills, will you speak to people this way outside?
How true! Oh! Khalid.
Please leave my room!
Alas! Oh, Khadija!
You've crushed me.
Come on, don't hurt my feelings, I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Oh, poor thing! Oh, Khadija, my light, I wish all children had his tenderness and feelings.
And when you see a quiet and kind person, you say they are like me.
Shame on you, it's wrong of you to say such things about your brother.
Stop, you're making a fuss over nothing.
"I swear to God, he just puts on a really sweet perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?"
Here I tell you, don't say that in front of your father.
I have it.
I'll show you, but be quiet, so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How do these girls gather?
It's a shame for a beautiful girl like her to do that!
Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I'm afraid he felt something was connected to him.
Give yourself a break.
I know you're following the popular Bluetooth technology these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yes, why?
Do you want to drink something?
I'm seeing you sleep here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He's afraid of him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
Seek refuge from the devil, my son, for my sake!
I have already booked.
I'm going far away. How do I face people? I can't!
What should I tell your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these kids just bring trouble.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khadija was little.
Of course, this is the result.
Stop, please get out.
The right thing always hurts.
The jar was broken.
I can't live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone has been off for a while.
And you're blaming me, Amal?
You are a girl and you spend all day at home.
What should I say when I'm a man meeting people all day long outside.
Tough, Amal!
I can't live, spend my day, and live my life with my head always down.
Dad feels for a while that something is wrong in the house and that there is a change.
How much longer will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my parents and sometimes I don't.
I can't blame him, Amal, when I recall his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he leaves the house and the responsibility of the children is on the mother.
We don't want to dwell on the past right now.
Does the father know or not?
But I'm ready.
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock on my father's face.
I'll be devastated.
Whatever, Amal!
He knows how to throw for us.
I know much better than someone else.
Alas, our house has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb called Immortality had exploded in it.
And customs and traditions.
You will find them impudently.
They are closing their ears to it.
And they don't want to hear it.
They hear only one voice.
Which is dirtiness and strangeness.
They trample on all that is good.
What's on your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, "God help you, my son."
God helps you.
The people who come back to get the gift are not the people who are going to travel.
You're right.
This is a rule.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did you see him, my daughter?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Daddy, what's wrong, Daddy?
Daddy!
Don't be sad.
You are a great person.
Any man would want to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because there's something wrong with you.
I divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept to be the uncle of my children.
I'm like your brother.
"Fasaluh" is
You're here every day.
Before you come, always.
I was hidden underground.
That was before we were underground.
These are very strong words, can you handle such words?
"You take a thousand and two hundred, work a lot of money!"
Say what Allah wills.
Come on, come on.
I've only been here for seven months, stop complaining and take me home.
How embarrassing and shameful! Every time he takes me to someone's house, their driver asks, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
He's laughing at you, driver.
He came less than seven months ago.
He bothered me, my son, he bothered me.
Give it back to him, so we can get rid of it.
Return it and take another one!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what's behind this word! He doesn't know how much it costs in time and money.
Leadership training. Return it and be rid of it!
The first time I came here was six months ago.
Alright, now I'll tell you something new.
Fuel is now $114, before it was half a riyal, maybe five riyals per liter. Everything has become expensive, my friend.
Open your mind and listen to what I say!
When I came here for the first time, what salary did you offer me?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, very new. You've been here for only six months and a salary of eight hundred is a lot.
I need money.
The driver you're talking about is ahead, ahead, and you're new.
This seven hundred is now eight hundred.
Come on!
He said he would only give me an extra hundred riyals.
And there is no benefit in three hundred.
Is what I told you the right thing?
No, no, screen. I'll get into trouble if I escape.
No, I'm afraid, Shashi.
Those who flee from their citizens.
Why are you afraid?
Because he preceded the shepherds of these people.
Give them a salary between six hundred and seven hundred. Do you know how much they take?
How much do you earn?
Why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.
God is sufficient.
Nasser woke up, and I told him to go and see it.
There was no one.
So he could steal the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
What have you done!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and put it with theirs.
You can go! Oh, my lord, your apology is accepted.
We'll look for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They cause us problems and harm us.
I told you to send it again.
But do you think I'll let him go?
I'll find him no matter what.
He will come back, meaning he is coming back.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than leave him here to make money.
I've come this far, I hope to find him.
Men, come in now, no one is buying now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what are we worried about? We were worried that our team wouldn't score goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were afraid; you were scared of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust from you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Great! The foxes have scored, you're ahead by one goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thanks, man.
Why try? You can't beat our team!
Your happiness, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, "It's a big problem."
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up for the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend, Sajid.
Take it, boss!
What did he make for himself?
Yes, he is the Indian man.
Yes, man, he's crazy about football.
Don't say that about my team, the Foxes.
They're going to win, they're going to win.
Come on, Sajeed, come on, Sajeed, hurry up, hurry up, the match is about to start, hurry up. Take one water with you, the foxes are playing today.
Dear viewer, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club, named Tha'loob.
They say you defeated them because they were incomplete.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What's missing? Each team has a dozen players.
Whether one or two are present, it won't make a difference.
This fox is very clever.
This is the best fan we have.
Alright, on the occasion of Oh! Fox's victory, a final word you'd like to say to the foxes.
All words stop.
When they say the name of foxes.
His name is high in the sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him enthusiastic like this.
Come on, sweetie.
Where is the Indian man who is a football fan?
Haven't seen you in a while?
Come on, he's a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Villaggio called Starbucks or something similar.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café and he didn't have money for a cup of tea.
He gave the boy twenty riyals as a tip in front of me.
What made him like this?
Dude! He's sitting with the bigwigs at the club, they're helping him and doing everything he wants.
May I say something, student?
Yes, uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support such a weak and bad club.
These foxes are my team and my heart.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes there.
I haven't heard the poem, my lord, that he wrote about governance.
We had a match against them.
Please, student, read, read this poem, read, read.
My uncle. Oh my God, who knows my secret.
My spirit is in great pain.
I never sleep at night.
You know we're the Fox Fan Club.
Can you tell me the winner's name so I can have an exclusive scoop?
We will hold a press conference, and if God wills, we will announce the name of the winner.
Whoever spends.
The famous Thlod, this fan who was honored today by the Fox Club's management in a rare and amazing kind gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Foxes, on this beautiful honor and this wonderful gift, of course.
Do you think it's a pen or a watch?
This is it, Dad, I swear to God.
This is a sign.
I'm telling you, it's him.
We need to tell the police.
Don't go anywhere!
All fans, all, all fans.
No, no, no! Oh! My son, that's not it, it looks like him.
I'm telling you it's not him.
I was late.
I don't know the game times, brother.
Now how can we find him?
We just need to wait until the Foxes play their next match.
There he is, there he is, I saw him.
Okay, let's follow him.
Brother, you're late.
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Follow him, trace him, track him, follow him.
The problem is that we're not sure if it's him or not.
I'm telling you, Father, this is it.
I say the truth and wisdom, we go to them and ask them, and tell the driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Dad always makes things complicated.
We're reporting him, I'm sure of it.
Earth, may God preserve it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered under my name, yes.
Also the other land next to it.
Tell your father that Abu Abd al-Rahman al-Subji sends his regards, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we made a mistake, son. We came to your friends and thought you were him.
Glorious and Exalted is He, who creates many people who resemble one another.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, sir, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Present, if you please. Excuse me, I'm here to help you. Goodbye, may God bless you, goodbye.
And you say you're sure!
I have no idea what your father is going to do! I'm very worried.
What have you done, my child?
When, when, when I, I was walking and the bag handle caught on it.
And try to sort things out now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Before my father knows?
Shatter into a million pieces.
Okay, Mom, let's buy something similar to it as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Please, Mother!
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He didn't do anything.
Accidentally, he hit the bag against the vase and it fell and broke.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter!
Scared him and terrified him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy went?
Okay, if he comes, I'll talk to you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Aunt, I know where Walid is.
Come with me, I'll show you where it is.
Come on. Let's go.
Here it is.
Please, grandma, I don't want to go home.
Hide me with you in your place.
I didn't see the pot.
I swear I don't know.
This is how your father might scare you, according to what God might guide.
Come with me, my son!
Don't worry, my son, as long as I am in the house, don't be anxious, my son.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Waleed.
Please, Abu Waleed.
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
What did you find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
It's okay, my son Waleed, your father won't do anything to you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Yes, oh! My son, yes.
Are you leaving it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might hit it and break it.
He asked me and told me that you need to bring me one like the one you brought him that Walid broke.
He wants one exactly like this. I'll go and get this one, the last one in the store. He's very lucky. Where are the boys?
In the room, he studies.
Alright, take care of him.
Just this game and I'll stop.
Oh, wow!
Okay, then study!
Dad, just this one game and then we'll study.
Please, Dad, don't tell Uncle.
Oh dad, don't tell your brother. Oh dad, I promise this is the last time.
I'll call him.
And you in particular. You've insulted me, am I your friend at the cafe?
I'll tell my brother about you if you don't!
Present, I won't talk. This phone is in my pocket, if you want to study, it's fine.
My daughter, why don't you take him to a doctor?
"May God guide us, O Mother."
He scares him to death because he always beats him.
Poor boy.
Wait.
Mom, where's Amla? I don't see her with you today.
She goes with her.
My sister doesn't accept wearing abayas.
Oh oh! My daughter, I didn't tell you the story of Monira and her son Nayef.
She gave birth to a baby boy, God bless him.
And the same height.
Yesterday she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
He argued with her and was shouting in her face.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He needs to take his son and tie him up in the middle of the yard.
And then he tells him to do it again and pee in your bed.
It's a lot of fuss about nothing (metaphorically).
What did you say, Umm Munira?
I was telling her, "Eat everything, eat everything."
Eat and enjoy.
I am poor.
Mama, Mama.
It's good your father didn't know about you.
He'll kill you with his fists.
Alright, go take a shower before your father wakes up, or he'll make a disaster out of it.
I don't listen to your words.
I feel sorry for them.
They are crying and trembling.
I'm afraid something is happening to my children.
I have to take them to Uncle to punish them.
I'm nervous.
They failed, they were successful.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasser got forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
Frankly, I agree with his point of view.
Forget the feelings.
And my brothers must be punished.
Present, I'm going, I'm going.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He is wasting our time, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I warned you, but you don't listen to what I say.
You don't listen to me.
Born sinner!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Ah! Stop, uncle.
So that next time you study very well, study!
Alright, that's enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I made you jump one after the other and turned into falafel.
Be cautious when going with your family to public places.
He creates misunderstandings for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Oh my son, everyone has left, even the buses are gone. You're waiting for someone to give you a ride.
At the school entrance, meaning he is waiting for the bus. The bus has arrived and the children are getting off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father threatened him, if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back, boy! Walid, come back.
Hello and welcome, right away, to our new episode of our program "Without Borders"
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total and various energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone have six hundred and eighty-eight billion barrels.
Followed by Iran with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, then Kuwait and the UAE with nine percent.
Each one of them then comes to Venezuela with seven percent.
Then Russia with five percent.
The Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
In this episode, we attempt to understand many of the complexities surrounding oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
Despite its prices going through the roof.
Also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What appears later on the screen or can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because today the market is the main factor.
And not the producing countries.
The day that determines the price is market strength.
No, not OPEC.
Of course, supply and demand play a part.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
and stock markets and others
And move on to prices in speculation.
Goods like oil, for example
And tomorrow, God willing, it will reach one thousand dollars, God knows best.
Oil in 2004 jumped from forty-four dollars.
And today we see that even gas prices
It changes from day to day.
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
Always, for the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
And all this indicates that speculation has the power and control over the market now.
"It's changed a lot, meaning when we return to the traditional market in the past."
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked a major reaction due to its link to what is called the expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Effects
It could rapidly affect the oil market, either negatively or positively.
The impact is certainly coming and will have its effect.
Even speculators react to political effects.
May confirm, he will say, some will tell you that the American war on Iran is coming.
Here, what will happen to the market? The market will be optimistic in some way.
This question, Mr. Deputy, is now in light of what the White House has announced.
This returned the region to an atmosphere of tension.
This is the mystery.
But Fallon had seen this scenario.
Provides a quick snapshot of the oil market.
Today, we are, and the numbers prove that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: in the last seven weeks.
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have increased to more than half of the past five years.
Today, I mean... I don't mean to say...
Even for the next war, because today I tell you even the world has a profitable stockpile.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find long queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks caused by this problem?
What number do you think it will be? I don't know.
Two hundred or maybe three hundred dollars, perhaps less.
You might arrive if these tensions become real tensions.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country far even from oil-producing nations.
You'll see how the effect will be opposite on the oil market.
It could amount to three hundred dollars.
And shifted from stocks and others to the oil market. Today you will see more than two or two trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
There are more than a hundred rumors daily - I mean -
That these tensions in the region are awaiting.
April, as previously stated, will be the month to put an end to this war.
God knows, I didn't do it, I mean, Shiny.
In the area because it's now.
This year is an election year.
And the current American administration still has only a few months left.
George H.W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see, but do not foresee events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America won't pay anything; you, along with Iran and consumer countries, will pay.
The United States today
Now he depends on African oil and has many alternative options.
Look, no, let's talk clearly.
In your introduction, you stated that sixty percent
Oil reserves
But now they issue twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and anything they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves.
So-called deep-water production or deep-sea mining from the deep ocean
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They are playing with it and destroying it.
Important means there
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a significant factor, making these countries a tough number.
And the need of countries for energy
It certainly means there's something called a secure supply.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
About President Bush who is
Try to notice how political risks don't come from the Gulf states.
It means he didn't come. No, no, no, it's not about generosity because none of us deal with generosity.
No, he deals with great generosity there.
But not "in the current domain"
We are not part of a charity.
Or be generous.
But Karim is generous to Westerners, not to anyone else.
With America accurately.
Where is the market located?
Where we find economic returns, we will go.
We won't do it.
Like oil and gas
You'll put it out of kindness.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
It's not the rise in prices.
But the persistent decline of the US dollar
You are primarily like the Gulf countries and OPEC.
Exports must be in dollars, and you refuse.
Change the currency despite the currency collapse and therefore
Even if the revenues are not in your favor.
No, I didn't say it has to be 70.
It's the experts' talk, not mine.
Well, the dollar has fallen by thirty percent, and oil has risen more than this decline.
So if we take the base year as 2004
We see oil prices ranging between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
Of course it means
The price of oil increased.
But it's a minor increase, Vice President.
That means if we take it.
We consider it now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to two thousand and four.
Until the decline rate of the US dollar exceeded
The exciting thing is
React to the dollar's decline.
As the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market has started to give its feeling to.
Our concern now is to reduce.
No, the situation has changed. Maybe at the beginning of the downturn two years ago they were saying this, but the situation has now changed and there is...
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
The question is, why peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historical era.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
He says America in the mid-seventies
The gold standard that was on the U.S. dollar was abolished.
This is not true.
Okay, tell me later what's correct.
OPEC includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share of the world market
It's forty percent.
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Those who deal with the dollar in oil pricing.
If you set a price in another currency, everyone will get up.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, the shining stars.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big people.
Reserves but I consider them exports.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries organized under OPEC
Her market share does not exceed forty percent.
Non-OPEC producer and exporter
And this cannot be tied to forty percent.
What is not valued until it is lost.
Some countries have tried.
Not a real attempt.
You're the one who refuses because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries
Before, only one barrel was produced.
This is a loss if they import it.
And his currency rose significantly.
He sells his oil in dollars.
At his entrance or reception, he received it, took his money in dollars and then converted it into his local currency.
Its currency is not tied to the dollar.
Correct, but
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency is not pegged to the dollar, then you don't have a problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amid a declining dollar?
He has been tied for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and had great purchasing power.
This separation is not that easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, it's not like that here.
Divorce has its costs.
This is in the interest of these countries, not against them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, and there is Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf finance saying that there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman left the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in the Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been ousted.
He said yes and that there would be a study, but all Gulf countries must also cooperate.
Profit and loss must be examined with great care, free from emotions.
Leave the matter for inspection and let them come.
Look, I can get you other economists who can conduct another study.
What contradicts this study?
Global House said something very simple and organized and issued a report on March 8th.
Just four days ago
The Global House ID is the simple solution and requires a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing.
Its intentions or the five with Kuwait, about its intention in 2010 to issue currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a decision to delink from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
To see the United Gulf Currency
This currency will be strong.
Will be
As you said, one of the strongest currencies in the world.
And what will come of the reserves and the massive revenues?
That's why the Prime Minister focused on this when he said...
Gulf countries because no single nation can do it alone.
Unless it has a strong economic content
And today's economic growth, even to the euro, we see it.
Of course, you shouldn't forget that the central bank plays a significant role.
In the evaluation
And calculate the profit and loss.
From all these news
Tense situation
Two thousand and eight, as observers said, the global house said that this inflation would continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To stop the inflation process that
And here's my question now, when will the salaries of these poor people be raised?
I'll hear your answer after a short break.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, Saudi Arabia
He has 264 billion reserves.
And two out of ten barrels.
Nine out of ten produce daily.
One million one hundred and one and a half in Kuwait and production of one billion and production of two and seven tenths of millions.
Qatar, with a population of fifteen and a half billion, produces eight hundred and fifty thousand tons of oil. Oman, with a population of five and a half billion, produces seven hundred and seven thousand tons.
Bahrain is one hundred and twenty-five million and thirty-two thousand.
The total annual revenue was thirty-eight billion.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in 2006 was seven hundred and seventeen.
The total in 2007 is expected to be 799.7 billion.
To be in 1812 out of 10 billion.
While inflation devours the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it will increase in 2008 to three and eight tenths.
Kuwait represents fourteen percent, but in 2008 it is expected to be eight and nine tenths in the United Arab Emirates.
It will be ten, while Saudi Arabia was six and a half, and it will reach six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are eroding.
So, what amounts and percentages will you give to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Actual solution
Salaries are always on the rise.
It's not the solution.
I'm not against raising salaries.
Not true, I, not true
We always
Of course, there is faith.
In the case of an increase, an increase without control over inflation will cause inflation to devour all these increases.
To solve inflation, a committee comprising all experts and specialists is needed.
And now this committee is forming.
Because salary increases in the world
Of course, the golden rule of economics says
It won't have an end.
And whatever it is
A significant increase in salaries, and what matters is how much the increase is.
Inflation is rising.
The solution is necessary and must be found.
A scientific study here from Bait.com, a recruitment specialist, conducted a study with the help of the British company YouGov, Sarraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially experts and those with career paths, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
They are thinking of moving from these countries where inflation continues to devour.
Now you will lose.
This is the simple concept, you put the simple concept, and try to implement it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The balance is available.
He is there.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are doing our best.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem but rather exacerbate it.
"يزيد يعني" translates to "It means increase" or "It means to increase."
We hope to have more time for this committee to finish.
All applications
This is boredom and your happiness.
Boredom always exists.
Right, but the government tried and implemented a forty percent increase.
No, there's an important point about raises here.
As for increases, you only want Qataris as if non-Qataris are working for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
Consider Qataris but do not consider non-residents.
While the higher ratio is present in it.
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone is talking about it and suffering.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we saw.
In the public sector
On the contrary, the government sector has grown.
Because the best units and competencies started.
I also read a report, as you know, we are in an oil field.
Work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these matters, what is the rate of increase in salaries?
Hope is with the great God, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
Only a temporary solution
And we'll see, I'm sure.
It will be
Positive results
It will be at the edge of fifteen percent.
Well, the second nice report says that twenty billion barrels of oil will come to you and thirty-four billion cubic meters of gas.
No comment, it's not the spraying operation.
The procedure, of course, we...
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on the people.
And what would reflect any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And the opposite of that.
The "dialogues" in the country are also part of it.
Even if these massive "bearings" and large projects didn't exist.
In this country, it's not part of inflation yet.
Resulted in some inflation
This also led to a lot of money in the market.
First, regarding the dollar's link to oil.
Oil for protection
I am from the United States of America, and thus stability in power.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, O Saad.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God.
Indeed, a good episode and a good title.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is currently under American policies.
American policy in its war now, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. deficit with Japan also reached six and one billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in 2000.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billions while now investing with the European Union at more than twenty-seven billion dollars
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar the inevitable currency in the whole world.
Brother, I say buy now.
And the Gulf region will become.
As a place
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasea from Egypt
Hello, Your Excellency, the deputy with you.
Middle Eastern rulers, Your Highnesses, remind me of...
When there is
When there are calls for price adjustments.
Adjust the salaries in the returns according to prices just as you said, Your Excellency.
In Qatar, we considered you a prototype.
And he insisted on not promising an increase, this is a very Arabic style.
We want, we consider Qatar as Abu Tricka.
He has the right to say what he wants. If you have a question, that's certainly his right. He is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
He must take into consideration.
This is one second that must be answered to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are people from countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and His Happiness.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and good, that's great.
Present, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will always be, God willing, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar and we are certain.
And ruled that Qatar resembles what he said that the money goes to the ruling family and to the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Let's first respond to the brothers.
I can't judge.
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities, almost like Pearl and Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar is expanding.
This is not the case, the case is
Suitable urban plan
In short, since we still have two minutes, tell us what Qatar will choose.
Qatar now, there is Qatar after oil and gas.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because it is he.
Non-renewable origin
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, today's trend in the State of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city includes the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today oil and gas
Of course, we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
It's not just Al Jazeera, it creates a hundred Al Jazeeras, and of course we don't stand with Al Jazeera.
Because my brothers are the leaders of these countries, our Gulf countries now.
In the seventies, the boom now, everyone remembers the seventies boom.
Now when we see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
This requires a special episode about Qatar after oil.
With our vision about oil, its future and resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I send my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without borders, and peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Direct greetings this week from the capital of Qatar, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
The Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006
And there is still unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled
With her older sister, Saudi Arabia, about two years ago.
At the same time, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanese file that succeeded when all other files failed.
To gather Lebanon's leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led to their safe return.
To the final elections
Also difficult files
What mattered to him was to be the driving force behind these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy is based.
And who does it serve?
Qatar, the smallest country geographically and demographically, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable him to do that?
That will be in a direct dialogue with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Qatar.
And for our viewers who want to participate, they can call us through the program's numbers that will appear later on the screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera's roar fires up cannons to improve ties with Saudi Arabia
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its edition published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the confidential treatment?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Not like this at all.
What I believe is accurate.
In many interviews here on this program, I always used to say that the accurate thing is that
And consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
In addition, the
And different viewpoints.
It is true that the border issue was addressed and it was a major obstacle.
The historical ties between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were special.
These links, if we notice them.
Between the two countries and both families.
Devastated by the misunderstanding.
Neither from us nor from them.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And now the relationships are in a position that I can confidently assert is excellent.
In favor of the Cooperation Council
But how was the situation between the island and Saudi Arabia improving, while the island of Aqaba was the obstacle and the reason for that in 2001?
There is an important point.
And I repeat, whenever I went back to all the shows, I always said
Not just the elder sister, I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was a heated exchange of words, and it was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves
Unsuccessful when the brothers agreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatari house.
They found themselves in conflict.
Where there are no camels.
And I don't think it's a strategy of anyone involved in this conflict.
But excuse me, Sheikh, let me put things in perspective or dot the i's and cross the t's.
Many observers believe that the island has undergone significant changes in the past few years.
At the time when cases criticized on Al Jazeera's screen were still ongoing.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia.
Whether the arrested people, the opponents, or others, they are still standing.
The island stopped dealing with these issues.
The island's coverage up to Hajj has turned into
Praise for the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a different time.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter, don't ask me because
What connects the two countries.
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you mean is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases surrounding the Gulf region.
Also, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques' call for the Grand Mosque and the Prophet's Mosque in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, overcoming, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just in terms of opinions
No, it's about politics and politics is a matter of opinion.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
While in the developed world
Talking about the same interest.
Now you've remained for many years.
The situation now
Listen first.
There's a difference between this topic and that topic.
The idea of a small country standing up to the big powers and making them feel weak.
Every difference or misunderstanding.
She has her reasons.
And its reasons have ended.
Alright, because of his ruling, he has led us both astray.
Are there any guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between two parties.
Based on love, brotherhood, and the interests binding the two countries.
And leaders, their words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We very much hope that the Saudi-Qatari relationship will develop.
For the better and there will be more fields.
This relationship is like the one we have with other Arab countries, the other Gulf states.
Because Qatar is an important country.
Well, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because the bad thing is that at the same time you are reconciling with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
The Island
Are you pro or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?
Let me start with this first.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And his interest
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
And this is the case.
Some people think that through this case, we are trying to reach an agreement with our brothers in Egypt.
In light of what you say, you respect Egypt and the Egyptian people.
We believe he is a good person.
Our differences with Egypt are on two points.
Or a single point.
We were accused of planning to overthrow Gaza, which I don't believe.
And we do not interfere
In cases concerning other countries
Interference in the affairs of any state is not believed in unless there is an opportunity for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip?
Of course, I don't deny, in fact, we didn't know about this as much as others did from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or caused disagreement between you on this point?
I'll come to this.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very surprised about this subject.
Shook for the benefit of Qatar.
What does the pyramid say?
The pyramids spoke.
Attacking Egypt and its position.
Can I reply?
Let's go back to the plot they mentioned.
The days will reveal that.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we go back to our Almina conference
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the lighthouse that was built in Doha?
And that was an agreement, and when the conference was to be held with us.
They said we don't want to hold the conference.
Oh people, we know that you are communicating with Israel.
"Heading to Qatar and this is it"
Why do we try to understand why?
We sat and talked, and the conversation was always good.
You have two parts.
"And what about them?"
There is a disagreement.
In political orientation
If we look at the penalty conference that was held
His Royal Highness spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We were informed by a foreign state.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a viewpoint on the matter that it should not be retained.
And people are being killed while we watch.
If you want her to be in Doha, we can keep her anywhere in the Arab League.
And it would be shameful to discuss the issue at the Kuwait conference in contrast.
By Israel and the Western world stand and watch what is happening.
When we all said okay, this is a custom and there is no power or strength except from God, we as Arabs cannot stop it, no major country has stopped this battle.
Egypt's request for a ceasefire in Gaza was heeded, and within an hour the battle ceased.
Even us too.
We should not take the Arab street so naively, our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
This is within international standards.
And there are not enough hospitals and doctors, and they are being arrested at the borders.
You were the ones standing at the border.
There, and no one can enter.
The two brothers didn't receive him well.
Because Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of the national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we're just talking about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this does not undermine the Egyptian position.
And we wish a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that he can carry our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
To all other parties
Even the rescue mission after Gaza
The Europeans tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it's a conference, saving this and that, and considering it a government bailout.
We were invited to a conference; we were contacted for coordination among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
It will be released for
The affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and this was it.
Because entry is prohibited from every side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect
Just give me two minutes.
One minister boasted of what had been denied and said
And whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official has done his country a disservice.
In fact, they didn't fail and they didn't talk about anything but themselves.
Those who helped them in this matter, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To conclude matters in the Arab world
We agreed.
The king will decide that this is in the best interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for anyone to say that we stopped them is an insult even to those who stopped them.
As if they were students in a school.
I believe this is it.
The limit has been reached.
He believes he must impose his strength.
We are sorry, we are sorry for this.
If you believe that a small state does not have the right, then its rights are taken away from it.
And you interfere and cause trouble in Darfur.
It's an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah plot plus Qatar
A plot from who knows what in Qatar.
If that happens, perhaps after swine flu, and it appears somewhere, Qatar will be the cause of the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country, aware of its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a balanced foreign policy.
If Qatar can resolve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab dispute can weaken our position vis-à-vis our core issues, namely Palestine and all the other challenges we face.
The Arab world has become a receiver.
Even our analysis has become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there is one thing we know about him, we know what happened in Pakistan.
In a way where I want someone to receive me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Did Qatar insult any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
I can come and say "Salam alaikum" and you'd reply: "You're saying hello to provoke me."
This is another case, it means you have a problem or a deficiency.
This case doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems
We always say it.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
In Kuwait, and I know this man is honest.
A man speaks about what's inside him.
"I always tell him these things."
I always say this thing.
I always say that even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I was saying this.
And you can go back to all the documents you have on the island but
The situation is different, no, no.
From one perspective, we said no, this is it, we stop at this situation.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
To see their own affairs and where their mistakes are
And we see our mistakes, it doesn't mean that everything we have is right.
Are you referring to this, Your Highness Sheikh?
Due to internal problems in Egypt
They want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any way to a conspiracy against Egypt externally and tries to break its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million if we can work, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
You played a role in the Shalit soldier case despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And you looked with the Frenchwoman.
We received a call from a friendly country.
There's a situation we need to address, we said, brothers, this situation concerns the Egyptians, they said.
We want to see this case as a request.
From Israel and another country, we want to see another part to see this.
When we saw this, we told them that if the same conditions apply, the brothers should talk to the brothers in Egypt.
And we announced this means is there an official responsible who can say we are in this situation, meaning he deceived the Arab League.
This means he's a poor colleague.
How did he manage to pass us?
Allowing President Mahmoud Abbas to stay.
And we supported this.
Does he address his people? Does he address us? Does he address the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own the island as I was accused.
The island must engage in the media competition where there are many media outlets in the West.
There are a lot of media outlets, and during their adolescence, they all curse at each other.
But after a while, they will reach maturity.
It might be or it might not be
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There is also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country; Egypt is the largest Arab country.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
A personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a difference of opinion in policies.
I told you about the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and we still don't know what Qatar did to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
With its leak to the press, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irrevocable separation
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say this, no one explains it as you comparing yourself.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said, "If Egypt obtains the appropriate satisfaction."
Satisfaction among children
In my opinion, Egypt is much greater than that. I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for how to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything like that, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I call
Someone told him there was a way.
And our pride in Egypt
There must be a certain way.
Either he stands with me or against me.
And any pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we struggle with it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has the sources of China's power and the sources of France's power and the source of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
It is clear that
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I took that into consideration.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say we have any sensitivities.
No one will take us.
As for Israel, you are now squirming.
Present before I go to Israel.
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America. If I can tell you about the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us based on self-interest, and so do we.
All complaints and everything.
To sabotage the relationship.
I believe that any great nation that does that will affect its image.
It will also affect our Arab pride if we continue to complain about each other.
Everything comes and we know everything.
Our solution depends on Arab interests.
We're here for them if they need anything.
Are there imminent steps to mend the relations?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If someone is tampering with the strings.
Against the interdependence of the two countries and the two leaderships, he will find himself losing.
No, it could be tomorrow, or maybe in ten years. To be honest, I don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we'll be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we attend, and if we have a point of view, we express it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is our big sister, but we have viewpoints and discuss together.
This is all that is required. When the time comes, we will be very happy.
Which were cancelled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you're asking about the number of contracts that were cancelled, ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, on the fourth of last June, you embarrassed the feelings of Arab countries when you closed the Israeli office, and it was published in Arts on June 4th.
Why do you say we've been fooling them? If we had intended to fool them, we would have closed it down twelve years ago.
Since everyone was launching a campaign before reconciliation with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab states and Israel
And after reconciliation with most Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or on the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to stir emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner for Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
I was one of the many guests who attended this feast, and I don't know what reason the ambassador had for hosting it.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the pain of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space for the Egypt topic, but unfortunately...
It's not me who did it, it's you who did it.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
My grandfather is involved in resolving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been solved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran, despite its poor relations with the United States.
First, we must place it in the context of internal affairs because it is necessary to respect each country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this your vision as well, or do you see the agreement still standing, or will you have to establish a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a phase that would lead them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day after day, minute after minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened in a constituency to correct some misunderstandings that had occurred.
But you still have something to do regarding the arrangements in Lebanon.
We're always close to Lebanon; you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and enjoy visiting there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
A quick question and answer about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Hotin affair, and there are accusations that you supported them.
Or your interventions put them face to face with the state, and now there is a greater danger, the danger of the South.
And we've been through a lot, which explains why we're standing here and not there in Qatar.
And indeed, we faced great pressure, but this was our vision and this is the position of His Highness the Amir.
The topic of the two whales.
Its stability affects us positively, and its instability affects us negatively.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand if it's supposed to be used for other reasons.
And to be there with them, and we always stood with them in all situations.
And what is based on the truth?
I see no need for us.
We sell it.
I say this with apology, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, thank you as well for listening, hoping that we have explained to you some of Qatar's foreign policies.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you from Without Borders.
Peace and blessings from God be upon you.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you and welcome to this special interview.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why do I say a special and exceptional interview? It's because...
Qatar and this man were exactly the main sponsors.
Sir, a simple and direct question.
I believe it happened because there was Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the management of the Lebanese from both sides was crucial.
To achieve some results
It is very important that external intervention
Many opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and international Arabs if you want to say
He went through stages, but it meant something.
There is nothing unless these stages are present.
Does that mean the complications are in Lebanon?
From the Time of Truth
I mean, when I was focused and directly engaged on the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file right now.
Have you discovered that the Lebanese complexity is great?
Lebanese Arabic international regional needs major decoding
Is it a simple compound, but magnified due to external interference?
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese shouldn't allow it.
To affect peace and security in Lebanon
Problem number one
Are the spillover effects in Lebanon?
Suddenly, after twenty-four hours, she decided to take everyone on one plane.
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They didn't even expect it, and they couldn't rest for a minute unless you were kind and allowed them to.
The secret is to not let them rest and think too much.
And level the place of many conversations.
We propose bringing them to Doha because we need a suitable atmosphere.
Or you will gather them with great difficulty.
In many circumstances
Let's get them out of these situations and into ones where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly.
God made us succeed with the Venetian Statement or the Beirut Statement.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some people believe that Qatar leans more towards one side at the expense of the other.
And I'm from Beirut.
His Highness's policy is that if we are mediators
In this process
Absolutely frankly
Did you consult seriously?
With at least the main parties concerned about what is happening here in the Kingdom of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
And he showed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we...
Everyone needed a solution.
Her justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
Her justifications are weak.
It was supposed to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
There is the case of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at resolving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
And organize conferences to find solutions, why can't the Arabs, who have ancient ties, do the same?
Unite the Arabs or the parties if they exist, or intervene to support the oppressed.
Must be under study.
If we want to be a wake-up call for the Arab League, not the league, the Arab world.
The Arab League is just a tool for implementation.
One of the officials was here, and he is Speaker Nabih Berri.
requires
Now it seems the Lebanese have agreed.
Okay, listen, we...
And upon them Qatar.
What led one day to a result.
In favor of the Arabs
It will be considered a strength for the Arabs.
We tried it.
At the United Nations when we went to the Doha Agreement
And agendas were prepared for the sake of resolution, not other reasons.
There is no doubt that
And play a more important role in the entire Arab world.
puts
Stop it by our agreement.
For others to come and help us.
Because this is a serious matter.
Why have we reached a point where everyone is meddling in our affairs?
In our yard.
It is very important that we put the interests of our people first.
Now we need the Arab League after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do for Somalia?
What will we do about Somalia, which is not a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and a small one.
I hope this isn't just a suggestion, this idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that first, if we're not asked to do something, we'll do what we can.
But I am certain that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It could just be a phase.
And we will find, God willing.
Nevertheless, I insist on asking, if it's acceptable to you, is it possible for you to take on a role in this part?
Even if it's not explicit right now, you kind of have the confidence.
Any rapprochement between Arab states do we seek in it?
And this has been His Highness's policy since the beginning, but this matter...
What happened in Lebanon, does it indicate that the region is on the verge of fundamental changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is local and Lebanese affairs from the region.
Not related to the situation.
I wish the opposite, I wish this was it.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
It's going to happen somewhere else.
In other words, Your Highness, are you afraid of the escalation that happened recently?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There's no doubt I still have fears about Palestine now, the Gaza issue.
I want to ask
We need something else.
I request to take care of the human aspect in Palestine.
We can't get the medicine to them.
And I didn't eat.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
The one who dies when the power goes out.
I wish
The Arab League agrees to the amount for this matter, which is food and medicine, and we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver them.
Let the Red Cross handle it.
But sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, but I'm saying that as Arabs, we need to deliver medicine and food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a great effort and promised at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
The statement that we won't deal with this party because we will find you a solution is incorrect.
And I
So far, I have no signs of a solution.
Are you afraid of an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us they don't want you to have relations or ties with Israel.
Some people might consider it necessary for you to be a part of it due to the American rules in place.
We know how to handle this.
Some people said that after the Emir of Qatar's visit to Saudi Arabia,
He may have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, negotiations between Syria and Israel.
I could say it was a coincidence.
The second point, the Saudi kingdom was keen to find a solution, and I was in communication with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours?
Change the tactic, not the negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other parts
We, as those responsible for
And from all sides we shut ourselves in the room.
And in the end, we found ourselves... then His Highness's intervention became of great importance.
From this, the intervention action is determined.
Without me mentioning it now, it's over.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, and our role."
I wanted to take on a role without provoking any other party.
Whether Arab, national, or regional
But nevertheless
I became responsible.
Did you want that or not?
We try to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
These countries
Can do or not?
I believe this will be the profitable combination.
The final question, your relationship with Washington, is it long-term? Is it ordinary or distinctive?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
It means we have different perspectives in these situations.
But this is our right if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good it is, how can you interpret it on earth?
If we talk about the economy, he is excellent, and if we talk about education, he is excellent.
Also health, but if we talk about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and clarify it in the next phase.
In my opinion, we should set aside confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop playing in the Arab court
And repair the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion to be a respected force.
I don't think we have
To be effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome to our viewers in this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to explore the political reality of the Arabs and Arab efforts.
Sheikh, welcome.
To investigate what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can
Shed light on some of your questions.
The brutal entry of Israelis into Gaza
Our goal was for the Arabs to be united.
Dealing with friendly nations
And the sisterly countries
And how to find a clear and strong Arab stance that Arab states
And then, we find the reconciliation areas.
From our position, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an offensive manner
No one was punished during that time.
We are punished for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialized people.
In the world and the only ones always targeted
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
To the extent that we cannot
For coordination at the leadership level
To halt the discipline campaign
We did not wish to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other oral agreements.
Two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
Those who wish it to be true and our view to be wrong, because the goal...
It's to solve the problem, not to hold a summit.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we're asking for now is for the minister not to cancel Qatar's request.
Which was also confirmed by His Highness
In the speech he gave, we did not insist that it be in Qatar. If it causes embarrassment, we do not insist that the summit be in Qatar; it can be anywhere.
An Arab stance where others respect us.
Yes, and ministerial.
We want to inform them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He played a role in the decision and continued to kill and bomb in Gaza, and he is still doing it.
And I need to ask the Arab what we should do about it.
What are we going to do?
Is it when Israel ends?
To implement the remaining Security Council resolution
There will be a strike because Israel didn't stop.
"No shooting, we don't shoot our brothers."
To a decision that is considered final.
A few days ago
We'll talk about the ministerial meeting.
You will eventually support this.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and it was our idea. Some other countries also requested the summit, Syria and Yemen.
There is already an Arabic crack available.
Or they arranged us for the moderation camp.
And the camp of immoderation.
And what do they mean by "immoderation"?
That was arranged by the West.
As moderate and non-moderate Arabs
You won't find a moderate nation or a non-moderate nation.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is immoderation, does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And end the matter in a humiliating way.
We just need to open the case.
I mean, this is an important question.
Are the countries
They follow Israel's plans and wish to solve problems in their ways.
What I want to say is that he follows Israel's plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name the camp Moderation
What is moderation in the eyes of the West?
Do we agree on slaughtering a certain group of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections took place.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I speak from an existential perspective.
The existing truth is that there is
Idea
What some people call radical action
But we must ask ourselves: What does this radical movement demand?
Is he claiming something that is not his right, or is he demanding his rights?
Or shall we arrange them?
And create other blocks as well.
Against because we are
Internal and cultured Arab
And it started to happen.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
I can't say it was prohibited, there were some efforts and the subject is somewhat known.
Prevention topic
But as I said, we could have had.
Take a vote and get two-thirds.
But that wasn't the point, because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need. That's what we believe.
While others believed it was not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there is a decision in the Security Council.
But the decision rests with the Security Council; Israel said it would end and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again.
We don't enforce the decision on the weaker party.
What makes it different from the first meeting?
In amendments, disputes sometimes arise.
How much
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
We strongly support our brothers.
Also to communicate with the Israeli side and inform them
I don't think everyone is ready for this, we should investigate this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Forty-eight and we were committed to the truce. Forty-eight and the Israelis were not committed.
It's natural for disagreements to occur in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements
Reflect their attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the altercations she reported was
That there was a person who described Hamas' movement as a distraction.
Not even a little
This situation occurred and we responded to it, and a brother from the ministers was with me.
And I believe that this is what the West is saying.
They are radical movements, dismantling, and other names.
And we don't want to be men like others.
And that's always the case, and I don't mean anyone in particular.
Any foreigner they find.
In any Western country or Western countries you find
Among the Arabs
Present now, Your Highness Sheikh.
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her agenda must be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from all this? What is the position of the nation of three hundred and something?
A million Israeli shekels
That was issued after the decision of 1686.
The issued decision.
Israel has not executed it, it will execute it after completing the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
Who should be grateful for this decision.
We must demand Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel.
And if questioned about it, they will say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they...
If that's the case, no question will be posed to Israel.
He is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did I go to the Security Council and why did I link the Arab Summit with what was going to be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will try for us.
He needs to make a tough decision.
"Decision that" (Note:
Can make an official lose their position.
We were afraid of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to deviate from the topic.
Those who carried out the attack to rebuild Iraq completely at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
We don't demand from the Iraqi government, and we don't demand for the people who died.
No compensation.
The same thing happened in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Your Excellency
Your Eminence, Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory at the Security Council.
Listen, they had some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Consequences
Israel did not comply with it.
He will commit to it in two days, after a week, after he finishes the task.
Because they didn't agree with him.
Sorry, but people have to gather.
Because Israel agreed after the mission was completed.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am friendly with the West and I don't mind having any relationship with the West, and I am for it.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
In the end, they'll take one percent from our perspective and say we won.
What is victory?
Containing
I can't say now about the precautions because the decision wasn't made.
The council is master of itself.
You participated in the formation.
Yes, we participated in the formation to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went are enough.
I pointed to the Arab parties for certain interests.
In this regard, Your Excellency Sheikh
For two years up until now
Listen, I don't want to talk about the accusations.
I can't speak for whether we knew everything.
If they are people who
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there, conflicts began and the siege started.
Last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we'll let them starve until they're exhausted, because we don't want them to be in power.
These parties, Your Excellency Sheikh.
Clearly stated, the Palestinian conflict is...
I mean, if there was
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict.
You tell one side: No, you are one hundred percent right.
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I'm not claiming that and I'm not saying that.
But, the mediator is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And not only the mediator, but we Arabs as well are equidistant from everyone.
But we don't want him around, so we must end it by any means necessary.
Once for training troops right and left.
And once by surrounding them and not giving them money or salaries.
And whenever we create a positive model in the West Bank
Let the people in Gaza see how people are living.
Luxury living
While the opposite is true in Gaza.
He was invited to a second Arab ministerial meeting, but this time
Any talks still ongoing between Hamas mediated by Turkey.
This meeting that I was invited to attend seems to be trying to overstep.
It would be deceptive to launch another initiative.
We don't have any initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
You are asked to take on our role while we support any Egyptian effort made to achieve understanding.
But it's important.
Don't come.
Tomorrow with the party that seems to have triumphed over a second party.
And not the path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
Is this what is required from Egypt in your opinion?
The proposals now, the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, which should exist and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
Those who are injured on the other side, we must also take their perspective into account.
Until we perform these intermediate tasks
By the way, to get a perspective
Hamas' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into account, so how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in shaping without communication or consulting the main concerned party on the issue.
We just want, of course, to deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
We deal with authority unilaterally.
But now there is a split in one party somewhere and another party elsewhere.
This does not mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we must stop dealing with people either at the bank or at the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask for someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
And what did they announce about him?
First, regarding the solution, he did not specify a mechanism, but welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some consider it as a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but what I understood from reading this decision is that it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in performance.
Whoever stops the fighting.
I have no doubts about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you think that this decision no longer exists since Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things will change on the ground.
Yes, Your Highness, regarding the Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
Or an Arab excuse.
Or Arab conflicts that cannot be resolved, so it came to fill the void.
Supposed to be filled by Arab parties
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A platform that Arabs and Muslims should appreciate.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So, this is a natural role.
And that people should follow him.
There is no Arab consciousness to resolve the situation.
One says, "Let them finish the mission."
There must be a clear Arab stance, a clear cut from all this aggression, its continuation, and procrastination.
There will be an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I'm not talking about a war between Israelis and Arabs, we are the people who always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I am not calling for an Arab war. I am calling for...
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, of course you follow what's happening.
The proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Do you believe?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the politician who resulted from the military operation will now allow Hamas to set its conditions.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second thing
I don't know about this operation, I told you they are not available, they are negotiating now.
The second thing
Okay, for Arabs in the required places.
This is the Arab reality.
What we witnessed after the start of these operations
It seems that the Arab street is taking a very advanced stance.
As governments, we have...
Of course, I feel sorry that some people describe the gift of peoples
They tell me this problem again.
Representing the views of the people.
The presidents now.
I mean if they want to
At least they see what.
Of course, there is a high ceiling and a modest one.
To halt normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar to
The Israeli representative office in Doha was closed.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
Consider that the Arab side should be extremist and take extremist positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
Absolutely, if we had an Arab agreement.
A treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
To agree with our Arab brothers
If only there were clear Arab decisions and credibility.
They engage with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that do not possess any of them.
It's very important.
Don't be an agent for others.
He says why Qatar shouldn't be a role model in this field.
If this is the only model, we are ready to be in it.
But we also want
Qatar's model is committed as part of its Arab commitment.
Like
And no one sells one to the other.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to say our secret, I don't want to mention intermediaries.
That's why it's very important.
For formal invitations anywhere because we need to move beyond that.
Some called the ambassador, some staged protests, and some expelled the ambassador like Chavez.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some of them asked the ambassador and those who summoned the permanent member states, and all of these are films about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of people's demands.
Regarding high expectations, some demand the opening of fronts, while others demand that Syria open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we call for peace and we don't call for fighting with Israel.
"And we don't want to fight Israel."
To create a conflict with Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
What brings us together to talk to each other and overcome our differences.
What Your Highness Sheikh said caught my attention.
On condition that nations do not sell each other out.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street won't spare us.
Your Eminence, Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 during the Lebanon War?
Or there is a disagreement.
I don't think there are disagreements on the goals.
Lebanon was a liberated land.
Some parts are still supposed to be a United Nations deposit.
Or something like that
I mean Lebanon; we have dealt extensively with the Lebanese situation.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
So he can control and be the one with the upper hand.
Of course, there are countries that support them, and they are foreign.
Therefore, she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example with "invaded"
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
And how many sides?
While in Palestine, there is only one side.
But I can assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to a large number of Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the gap began, and each one thinks that he controls the other part.
In your opinion, as an observer and a viewer
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this because it might happen to those who disobey?
Or he expresses his opinion.
Whether Israelis or others in the future
We set a high example.
Obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral proverb that says: "I and my brother against my cousin; I, my brother, and my cousin against others."
Now we are supposed to be in disagreement with Hamas, but I'm not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible.
They all have mistakes.
Now we have to leave this topic.
Make part of it kneel.
Because here, failure will not be a group failure.
Your Highness, Sheikh Hamad, that is, before, was trying to put forward proposals.
Initiatives to reach solutions took place in Lebanon.
It happened in Darfur. We'll talk about this later, even if we're in a hurry.
We
I don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there is some sensitivity.
This whole country is taking all these initiatives, we don't have a problem as long as there's a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a headline.
What were His Highness the Prince's objectives?
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
Loss of control
What happened was beyond imagination.
We are in Qatar.
Do we know anything they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have sincere intentions.
To reach a respectable solution.
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative has achieved regarding Darfur and the resolution of the Justice and Equality Movement.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it will mainly be about solving the Darfur problem because the Darfur issue, in its inception,
The Arab helped.
But we are not raising an issue we have made international.
Based on revenge against the system, and now we want to solve the problem but we don't know how.
And we always strive, as mentioned earlier, to implement decisions; we are the best people to implement decisions.
Removing the status from the competition, is there also a competition in the Darfur case?
I don't want to do this.
Before we conclude, Your Highness Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit take place, and will you participate in it?
No, we'll attend the summit.
We wished it could be held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it was programmed.
It would be a shame.
Well, if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, they gathered there for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance with heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances. Of course, I hope nothing happens to us, but safety first.
And to maintain safety.
But no one takes anyone in their little pocket.
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
So what is the usefulness of this celebration and the truthfulness of the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
What about our Arab region and to what extent are they interested in this reason?
These and other questions will be asked of our guest in today's episode.
Former Special Rapporteur on the United Nations Conference on Disability
He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University, Egypt
He held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
In one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
And the vice president of the National Committee for the Disabled since 1999.
To 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Center for People with Disabilities in Shafa'a.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Hello, Ms. Hessa, welcome to this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
Initially, we used the term "disabled" perhaps in the 1980s and before.
A more educational concept when
Among those who provide them with such education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in thirty-nine.
On the term and before we move on to the details
From other regions, although there are regions that are not or are not classified as developing countries and are classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend there is the strongest compared to any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
The trend towards legal rights is present in the Arab world and has been found in many countries.
It is possible that resources and political will also exist.
Well, let me tell you that there are some statistics that you might be aware of.
Eighty percent of countries are poor.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of disabled children from poor countries do not go to school.
Mrs. Hassa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
He is largely genuine.
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There, you cannot distinguish between a disabled person and an able-bodied person because they are so numerous.
In fact, children suffering from female illiteracy, for example, amount to nearly fifty or two-fifty.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from accessing school even without disabilities.
In fact, the city doesn't have any infrastructure, even if this child found the school.
He can't reach it.
For children and other residents
These agendas and projects are great, but we barely hear about them.
What's the point of this celebration, except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago?
The situation in the world
Better than people without disabilities.
Organizations arrived and established numerous projects.
Implementing a very important health strategy.
Through this strategy
There is an intersection between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as persons with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and this is better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask her since she was at the United Nations before.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against systems that hinder society, for example, the Syrian intelligence system today.
Is there a law allowing the demand for the trial of the regime where many are in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraou from Syria, thank you very much. We have Naif Saeed from Kuwait, hello Naif.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome
If you don't mind, I am one of those who suffer from mental and intellectual disabilities.
Arabs say that a free man understands by gestures.
In the Quran, there is a verse that says: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah has given us speech. Praise be to Allah, Who has given speech to everything."
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
Praise the Lord, for He has enabled me to speak.
I was referring to the Quran and found...
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference source, and they consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me without knowing they're at the bottom of hell.
I was just insulted.
And he does not speak the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls under the same definition.
United Nations programs or their reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political goals or otherwise.
Go to various agencies and organizations.
To discuss with them, convince them, and find out to what extent.
There are disability issues and cases on their agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already addressed disability.
He is one of the programs that try not to lose sight of children with disabilities.
Good opportunities and schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings, we must also acknowledge shortcomings in the United Nations.
What are the most prominent weaknesses and inefficiencies that you talked about?
United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
My work is sometimes private, especially during restrictions or shortages.
Struggles or attempts to resist disabled people for recognition.
Until he reached a level that was somewhat satisfactory, unless he did not place it in a separate article as the Global Disability Movement wanted.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of her main flaws.
Poll, which was conducted by the Special Rapporteur and addressed to States
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies, and we only received three responses.
Do not put.
The issue of disability is permanent, stable, and ongoing for many years, although primarily it is a human rights issue.
In the recent period, praise be to God, two or three years ago.
The issue of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international regulations?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating a salary to people with disabilities.
Is there money allocated by the United Nations?
Will these funds go to governments or to UN offices, and will this aid actually reach the disabled?
The final remark is that there are no binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, welcome Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
To adopt this proposal.
This is to be written directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
To be converted into this box
Or a manufacturing plant
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
Go back to our guest to answer the callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to have surgery but
It's too expensive and beyond his means, so where can he find help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
The citizen must obtain all these rights and duties.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
And fulfill the rights and needs of people within the national scope.
Even at the non-governmental level
Binding on all States and must be adhered to in order to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of officials, there should be a primary awareness.
It must be at least this way if we work on these treaties like this.
Even if there is no great commitment to it.
Is there a response to the surveillance reports you conduct, and was there any interest?
But don't forget customs, for they are a morally binding document, not a legal one.
To have a commitment and for it to be legalized.
And he understood that these cases would be resolved or discussed or would be within the context of a community suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakher, Manager, National Center for Sign Language for the Deaf Expert at Al Jazeera
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to extend his sincere gratitude to Al Jazeera.
They just broadcasted this episode live.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all those in need at the place she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
And I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them don't know about this agreement because there were no training sessions.
About them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
It is essential to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And I would emphasize and insist to these countries that
Adopted and signed this agreement.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document to serve people with special needs and serve us.
Thank you very much, my colleague Naji, I speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion may contribute to making a decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we might start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A fund for donations and accepting any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on the activities that the Special Rapporteur engages in when he is busy with them.
Even the Arab countries did not donate, only one country: Syria.
Fulfilling those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, therefore.
The box
Lack of commitment and interest from member states, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, many people boldly say that we don't care about the situation now.
In fact, it's a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized in particular
But for this reason, there are those covenants.
These countries should honor their commitments, nevertheless, it was a good idea by the brother.
In addition, it is essential that there not be a single independent box in the sense of being independent in form, but rather organizations that already exist in the region.
What they have in their budgets
Providing private projects for people with disabilities in Gaza
Assistance for people with disabilities
The problem always relates to political factors.
His state or government has guaranteed significant support.
Unfortunately, it reduces the number.
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Of course, he was stripped of his citizenship.
Take his daughter away from him.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
Traveling or going out, we hesitate.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
And we can
They rebuild themselves with knowledge.
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Behjat Kawan from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed is from Qatar, hello.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; Parents of children with special needs.
For Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa's continuous support
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
At another level, the genetic
I believe there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a cousin always marries his cousin.
By this means at this level, the level of disability. Thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
Indeed, as I said at the national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Falls under healthcare services
which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
I believe in the mental clinic and also programs in the Supreme Council of Education.
The Special Education Department, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists.
But it is certainly within healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
Rehabilitation was provided for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, and it points to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage, are there campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Of course, this is a very important and serious point.
And there are things that I and others have talked about a lot and shared a lot.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, not just targeted ones.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
And also for UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia
There is now a binding decision for early inspection.
which have been implemented in many countries
All of this is from the preventive side.
And do such campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when it goes against customs and traditions.
Of course, its difficulty lies when it clashes with societal culture.
To have a decision, to devise strategies, to have the will to deal with it and the commitments.
The issue of early examination, for example, because it is a very important issue before marriage.
I ask if there are statistics on people with disabilities.
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
The Arabic region
And especially
Recent events in the region
In regions, conflict zones, and especially in wars and disputes.
For every person killed, there are three disabled.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
Absolutely, not enough, and first the problem
With the principles of human rights
There must be something for people with disabilities, their programs, and plans.
Agenda within institutions established in ministries in the government and non-governmental organizations
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, Navi Pillay.
In the world, the strangest thing is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of People with Disabilities said about the census.
To this extent, people with disabilities are not included in statistics conducted for residents.
What they always announce
For example, in the State of Qatar when the census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In cooperation with the Planning Council and with the
It was established by the Council as a matter of fact and with our participation as the Special Rapporteur's office.
To add more categories for disabilities
Needs are supposed to be discovered.
Types of those needs, all those important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
Statistics are somehow advancing in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Madam, thank you for this program and thank you, Sheikhah Hessa.
But I thank God that I am Qatari and receive all this care from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Its motivational role and its role in making us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, thanks to her, and to those who rely on this category.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is solving our children's problems.
Where is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope you can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you
And I testify to the special service provided by the State of Qatar for hearing impairment.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Until the civil society, non-governmental organizations, or other communities come together.
Because reality and what we hope for, if you compare it after five years,
What was offered to people with disabilities five years ago and what is offered now?
Many thanks to Karim Naseem from Jordan, now we return to our guest.
Of course
The society as a whole, its individuals, and especially its families with children.
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But for one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children who cannot obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
The international convention resembles many international documents.
I am committed to translating it into plans and strategies.
To automatically provide those services
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, irrespective of religion, race, color, gender, or sexuality.
Alright, Sheikhah Hessa, you previously served as a Special Rapporteur and spent six years working at the United Nations focusing on disabilities.
Did you wish?
Perhaps the time was not enough or the financial assistance was not sufficient.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, through existing organizations, and through government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and larger studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Awareness-raising is an ongoing process that must be worked on constantly and dramatically.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among people themselves, persons with disabilities and their organizations, because they
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They have to fight for
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinion and comment with us.
God willing, tomorrow we will meet a new guest.
Join us with your messages and calls in a new episode of "Live" (Live Broadcast). Goodbye.
Good morning
I'm very happy to have you here with us.
First, before we start asking our various questions and chatting with you this morning
Thank you, Shima. Maybe I was congratulating.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has really put itself on the world football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Also me, come on Ali!
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
I express my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
And if God wills, as Sheikh Muhammad said,
It was a dream, and if God wills, it will become a reality, and work will start today or during the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, weren't you afraid in this field, especially on this subject?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said there's a seventy percent chance Qatar will get it.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitive.
Why are we afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's file was very strong and deserved it.
It is true that the 2022 World Cup file and Qatar's hosting
What do you think the athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God willing.
I'd like to, we were talking off the air, but we want to hear that on the air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you, how did you receive the news, were you surprised, tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then everyone joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did the international media find you?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
Whenever they announced Qatar's win and hosting,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the international media level, Shima
I went this time to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP was filming there.
We also had interviews.
Everyone cooperated, Qatar now, daily, is being mentioned.
A hundred times a day, considering it the smallest spot on Earth.
I suppose everyone will get to know Qatar even online.
To host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two.
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country by being in the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
This is a positive thing, for a person to work very hard.
He is in the league, even when he is in the league he dedicates all his efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the responsible people have made a great effort in taking care of the young players, they teach them professionalism from an early age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience playing at different age levels. How was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step in the league, from the youth team to the first team.
You know camping with the club and with the league.
For every stage has a special sign.
Yes, God willing, Lana was moving between
Now we're used to you as the sporty Lana.
We always see you as a sportswoman. We love to see you and get sports news from you. So, how is sports with you?
I, frankly, don't find a difference between it and talk shows. In talk shows, we used to interview famous stars in their fields, and also in sports, we used to interview stars.
Like Ali and others in their sport.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And now Qatar has become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of offering a variety of talk shows, social, economic, and cultural programs
There are different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's still a sport.
Excellent, superb
Frankly, I wished
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
I think the young players got a great opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is great, Ali. What do you want to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who have a bright future in the coming days.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity, they should take advantage of it.
It's a golden opportunity.
They have a great advantage over him.
Tell us, what are you doing now, and what are the new programs you're going to present? I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
We always follow events, and we are preparing for the Asian Cup which will start in January.
A few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup. By the way, I'd like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
The newsletter is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatari TV, of course, my roots are from Qatar TV.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
Let's say the media message on different channels.
Whether they are private, sports, or other channels
So, thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you success, we are still on the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And its fans, I was at Al-Wakra Club since
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
Still at the club
I am still the son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the start of the program, professionalism.
What concerns every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people already love and are addicted to sports.
How to Make Sports a Social Issue
Media awareness primarily plays a significant role in promoting sports across all aspects of life.
I said that youth are addicted to it, and also schools have become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the streets, reflecting people's awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and elsewhere
This also indicates women's awareness and participation in the sports field.
And now we have a Qatari women's league, for female players.
For I believe that sport is evolving.
I also think that this period of time
To produce massive projects and increase awareness of sports, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If considered and implemented carefully.
It's enough, and at the same time it needs to be used thoughtfully, as I said.
Similarly, there is one point, which is how the young generation benefits from the league.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
Also, there's something important, praise be to God, we are in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies know, we are renowned for our passion for sports.
How do you attract this audience to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And attending matches at the same time
Most of the Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse forums on the internet, you find a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in my soccer league.
As a Qatari citizen, I believe the best way to attract me to attend, aside from being an athlete or player, would be to offer unique cultural experiences, engaging community events, and meaningful educational opportunities related to the theme of the event.
What is a possible way to attract the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there's no general concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a gathering at home.
For example, Japan, Japan developed a wonderful plan to attract the public greatly.
When you attend matches, you collect points or something, they are looking for solutions, so I hope that's the case.
and Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar specifically in 2022, Lana, in your opinion, what do we need?
Besides financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participate in major World Cups.
Time passed quickly with good people. When the producer told me the time was up, I said to him, "Indeed, God willing."
We always achieve the impossible, realizing the dream we thought was impossible. Praise be to God, we're living it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed says, they were moments of celebration, but serious work began.
And God willing, 2022 will be an event worthy of Qatar's name.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
Hosting in the year two thousand and twenty-two
Thank you, Lana, for the wonderful introduction. I wish you success, and I'll always follow your shows to stay updated on sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new genre that is popular nowadays.
But in a repetitive manner with music and a fast rhythm.
Also a rap group, God willing.
Stay with us, we're starting now and good morning.
We try to take a quick look at it.
We can briefly describe rap as fast music.
Repeating, but not rapid rhythmic singing of the song lyrics
Consisting of numerous rhymes, it addresses a variety of different topics and issues.
It can sometimes be personal.
Social, emotional, or political
Often controversial
And I'm quite liberal.
Rap is performed, our viewers sing along to the lyrics.
But he keeps repeating it.
He is praised for his voice, which is considered a secondary element.
Generally, sound isn't important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper or MC.
Rapper pay attention to the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, the flow of sounds, synchronization, and connection.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rapping.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to try something new.
To be distinguished by something.
So we said, "Why don't we rap?"
Rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
Why isn't he in Qatar?
So we said, "We are creating something new."
We gave him an idea that included a message.
We are discussing the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
First, we deliver a message, and second, it is an art.
It is a diverse art form, for the viewer's information, and has addressed many social and psychological issues among young people to a great extent.
Time changes, and I think this is connected to the change of time.
Before, there was a simple acceptance.
We've been singing since about 2005, acceptance was slow at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
There is greater acceptance and popularity.
People love to sing and perform in a style similar to rap these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, of course, a high percentage of people.
There's also something else I want to talk about. I was a co-founder of several teams.
A beautiful band, and I think you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about that someone could form a band, and how many are there of you in this band?
Initially, we were before the band was formed.
Rap came to Doha starting in 2005.
It means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing and upload it from the site.
I can go down, Salman can go down, someone can go down, so there was a competition.
We met the people.
So we started competing with each other.
After a while, after all these years, we reached the year two thousand and ten.
Before 2010, there was a group system, which meant that this group was independent and three or four were together.
So we said, "Why don't we unite as one group under the name Rappers Qatar?"
Or in English, Q Rappers.
So we agreed to this, saying under one name we are all one hand together.
And we come to present this thing and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people
Twenty-five, wow! God willing, it's a big group.
So does anyone here play an instrument, or does everyone just rap?
Organize and assemble
You could say it's personal.
Excellent, how are these twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Everyone has their own individual capabilities.
It means that every member of the band can create a complete song.
Without any help from anyone else.
But capabilities can differ; for example, if Salman is better than me,
He hears her and tells me the words, nothing else.
Each one can change for the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that adopts, so that official bodies adopt these works,
And there will be appropriate distributors.
So that the work comes out in a stylish manner and becomes something official for you.
Frankly, we hope to get support and to get backing from a company that comes and follows us by producing an album for us.
We don't have any problem.
Some things are a bit difficult.
Why don't you think the first move is up to you?
So that an individual can identify their first compact disc.
By doing that, you can attract companies later on, what do you think?
Around 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I believe.
Somewhat acceptable because in 2007, rap might not have been dominant in the Gulf.
But not as popular now.
We were talking before the broadcast, for example, there are great groups like Valencia and Castro.
Let's talk about her?
They said we're organizing the party for you.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was a great performance.
But there was a little pressure because there were no ads and there was nothing before the party.
There were no ads, or anything, two days before the party.
We assumed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
It was a good point.
This means that our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would only appeal to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many different age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many too.
The whole group
What are words, and how do they deal with different issues?
We are talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, before *
It has to be like this.
I mean, it rhymes.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Alright, you have some songs, let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs you created.
Let's listen to him and see the public's opinion.
I hope they like the talk.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it includes the name of my program.
This is the program of KD and DJ MREldoha.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KG Ms. Bobo with a hot SCT for the body.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
A product of good grace, presented by Shima Al-Hamadi.
The manager is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Rabee Qatar, of course.
Because it really contains the program's name, thank you guys!
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it last night.
And who wrote the words, was it him?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if you wrote to Joseph
It's not just about writing this because of the love of singing and passion.
I suppose you should write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I suppose if you can.
Yes, certainly, personally, we will produce a song about this topic.
But, I don't think he can be formal at this stage.
So I assume there must be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone
We are watching the live broadcast now.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
So, our viewers, as we have seen, Doha is decorated to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The concerned agencies have completed all preparations to host the event.
And there will be more crowds.
I suppose they'll gather along the corniche.
I'm sure they're ready to host that major sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up in the next few days?
There is an offer from an official party, they promised they would organize a party for us.
But, there are still some complications.
Procedures and some issues, therefore, I'm not sure.
So we tried, if you met Joseph and saw.
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of performing them.
When I'm at home.
And then send it to Youssef's email.
This part of the song is for Youssef.
In another matter, do you travel abroad?
In this field, he has millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but we listen to people who are advancing in this field.
But we try to be competitive.
Why don't we take some ideas and imitate certain things?
But its opposite, I take the idea and apply it differently to my song.
Those who formed a band and have more than one album CD.
A person named Abdullah Al-Dail
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
One of the residents of Mirror City
There are many experts.
Who determines the location of groundwater before drilling?
What is needed, or perhaps what can be done, is to drill some wells in places where there is no water.
With the help of copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or tin, through which he can locate water tanks.
What are the tools used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, it has been replaced with copper columns.
We aligned the two rods parallelly.
And she walked slowly.
We notice, when we walk along the watercourse.
The bars will open.
Now, we are crossing a stream.
It opens this way.
When we counted, he started to begin.
Now we are in the middle of a watercourse.
And here, the medium will be.
In this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater, in the earth.
And the process was repeated more than once in more than one location to find the site with the highest density.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
Upon reaching an advanced stage of this profession
To make his discoveries very accurate.
Sometimes, outside, in Diriyah, Harmala, and Al-Athithiyah
Over one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
He needs training, experience, and a gift from God.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdurrahman al-Marshed
Afternoon program
Marat Town, northwest of the capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh
We watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf states, if the will of drought prevails
And we arrived at different addresses, but they are all hers.
Meaningful
I suppose there's a large group of Gulf youths in the Gulf.
Which specific people do you follow as examples?
Follow him instead of imitating him.
In general, there is a connection between all Gulf rappers.
It's not a competition, I mean, if I released a song.
Who addresses a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have relations, but no one is me.
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing. He is...
He has fans and a CD.
Many companies are eager to adopt it.
Do you want to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it more and more, God willing.
We wish you success in this band.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's see some shots of the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
This, even if borrowed from the West, is in a Gulf style.
There are also rap songs about love and a unique band consisting of twenty-five people.
It's important to follow up with you to find out how you're doing.
Assume you have an email, website, or forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes open without apparent reason.
So we faced many problems and eventually closed it.
No use, the site is definitely closing.
What is the solution, what are the alternatives, to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You need to communicate with them to keep up with the latest news and the songs they produce from time to time.
What's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
Under what name
Okay, when you search our name on Google...
Qatar's rapper or rapper in Qatar
You can create your own video clip.
Regarding the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures.
I think we need to see you develop further.
You need a place for everyone together instead of having equipment in everyone's house.
Mixed, piano, computer, guitar
Frankly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
And allocated us a special place.
We work alone.
At the end of the day, we're still working on ourselves.
We don't want this.
It's no different from what Joseph said.
We need a video clip.
And album
Videos make SNG spread rapidly.
Conveys ideas more quickly
If there is support, everything else will eventually fall into place.
And your beautiful voice is everywhere.
It is a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for attending.
Let's see them and wish them all the best on behalf of our show, guys.
These projects were, yes.
There is also a semi-ready project, but it needs some technical developments.
Expiry Date
When you go to the cashier, you already have the total and all the details.
Knows the goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity.
And you walk with the cart
Attached to the shopping cart, so one can select the desired item.
Most projects reflect children's sense of a problem.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten objectives set by Her Highness, Sheikha Moza, when establishing the center.
Also possible, what?
What takes him directly from his house to the underground train.
But he thought it was for clothes.
All stores in Qatar that sell t-shirts will be displayed.
You can also use the car key, press the button.
He points out to me the things I've lost and leads me to the key.
Yes, let's get back to the projects the center will work on.
Early childhood education
Skills development and talent adoption
It varies between different children's skills, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking, persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we have developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with Future Media, achieved excellent results in this project, reached the end, and graduated the project.
We also got the numbers of the children and youth speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have young presenters?
Regarding television, it's important that they broadcast children's programs.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We prepare them until they reach eighteen years old.
We welcome them wherever they are.
Also, this is the national television.
We need to attract, identify, and nurture these talents.
Media, research
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Ministry of Endowments-funded Promising Speakers Program
Our exhibition, Generation Exhibition, is also...
The Science Club played a significant role in improving projects as well as providing technical support.
The main role was played by the Higher Education Council, through supporting schools and partners.
Mr. Abdullah, moving to a building like a drop.
which also includes a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider that a step forward towards more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the very large place
And it makes dealing with the public easier.
It is a pioneering and excellent project.
In welcoming the guest and introducing the programs offered to the child
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Development Project for Reading
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted and supported this project.
It's a big project, encompassing reading development, storytelling, and enhancing children's skills.
Various cultural skills related to reading in particular
Because there are certainly different programs.
We recently moved.
We are rearranging some activities.
Design and improve it to suit Katara visitors.
We wish you success, through this center.
Those that contain very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
The most important thing is that, the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Our childhood today is different from our old childhood.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, and his imagination.
You communicate with him mentally.
They ... %pw, the way they treat their children like a hotel, providing accommodation.
Or like a bank, it saves money.
Children really need someone to listen to those ideas and imagination.
In the past few days, they transferred us to 2030.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you for being here, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
Until these projects are realized and become a reality, not a dream forever.
Hello ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Cultural Center was launched last night at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing ceremony of the National Future Generations Exhibition for Dreams under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
Children's Creative Projects
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister.
First, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to meet with us.
Talking about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are happy to have you with us on the program to cover as many activities of the exhibition as possible.
This is the national exhibition of the dreams of a generation.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
In appreciation of the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the National Day
"Who was"
In an attempt to stabilize the children.
Living with a dream
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
So We determined it to be thirty nights.
And other key areas of Qatar National Vision 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Then, think about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What do you exactly mean by this phrase?
Is it facts or the nation of tomorrow?
Means, anything a child dreams of today.
He's growing with the project's expansion.
In fact, that was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children would live from that day forward.
I dream big.
Whether they are environmental, health, human development, or any other field
Who serves the country.
I think that when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
The exhibition, there were also guest of honor.
For children, learn from them, as role models.
Yesterday, a day or two ago, the *
There were also winners of various Gulf Cooperation Council awards.
There was a table to display their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
Here is also the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
A very great idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of which is the colored ball.
It is also called the Smart Stadium.
As soon as the ball went out of bounds.
Colors vary.
I suppose that in the future, this will help a lot in matches.
And what's next, after all these dreams?
And you will be connected to things related to his field of interest.
I assume especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects into consideration from small minds.
But we never know, maybe these projects will serve us. What does the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
Often, he visited football-related projects.
Support us and embrace these projects the moment he saw them.
He also adopted these projects.
What our children did, people also voted for many projects.
Okay, what were the projects that were on the table and received the most votes from people?
There is an evaluation committee that has a way to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards.
The forest, won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for submission.
Of course, it needs many administrative elements.
There were very fine details on the brochure distributed to visitors.
Surely these are the pictures we're seeing now.
These are some big projects.
They might be trying to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Indeed, part of it is adopted by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects, what are these projects?
Collect, use, and recycle.
From four hundred and forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-four students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman the Renewer and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a very dear guest today.
From the serial classification family, the actor Abdelhamid Charachni.
He asserts himself through numerous works such as "Hearts for Rent."
They strived to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
Means
Thank you and good morning. I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I'm a fan of the show's cast and crew.
We'll show you a very short scene from one of your works, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake bisht and keep the real pocket.
Soul and pocket.
You have the coat, and you're returning it.
What? Give me the best, return it to me! How can I return it?
The goat has already ground it in her belly, damn her.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
In the Higher Committee of the Conference
I don't agree with you.
I have no objections.
This is a quick glimpse, a very short clip from a series we'll be seeing the second part of.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your roles that cover different topics in each episode of the "Composition" series?
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, later.
I went through that several times at that time.
Marat is also famous for the mountain.
Comas that poets have celebrated over time.
When history is a witness and a lasting memory in the cities.
And it shows how old its history is.
Which is 170 kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
And some believe that he was named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
Distinguished by its ancient monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
Poets were inspired by him and fascinated by him. He was renowned for it, the famous Mount Cometh.
They call it Komaa Valley.
Of course, Mirror City is an ancient city.
Founded before Islam
There were some ancient things with an unknown history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we're in now.
The companion of the Prophet, Khalid bin Walid (may Allah be pleased with him), ordered the digging of this well during the time of the Ridda Wars.
It's still remaining until now.
The proverb says, "A hundred guarantees from a crowd," but I guarantee you many times over.
If you see a comet, you can see it several times.
Another effect is the Komet stream.
It's a stream where sweet memories have passed over the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
The date of creation of these artifacts is unknown.
There's also the bride and there is...
Mount Komet is one of the landmarks of the city of Mirror.
There were many proverbs based on this mountain, and poems and verses.
Many people from different parts of the kingdom come to it.
One of its important ancient sites is Bir al-Walidi.
This is because he remained in times during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He descended upon him and commanded the men to dig this well.
Some people still drink from its water and wash with it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed by Murād.
It's an old house made of mud that has been restored to its original state.
It consists of various sections reflecting the region's architecture, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet once said of her: "When we met water, it was free water."
We encountered a quantitative table, not an angelic one.
Mr. Ayman, there is, God willing, cooperation between the family, guardians, the center, and also the child.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
Because whoever comes to us, whether it's an apprentice, a student, or a child,
This record contains all his complete personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, every month he has a rating.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
The guard through a password and username
We gave it to him, can he reach it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, from the day he registered at the center until now.
Yes, we have different models to see.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim who will join us later.
We'll see different models. I wish we had enough space.
Nevertheless, we brought a model of a girl.
You'll do various tests before the broadcast.
We'll ask her math questions and different types of questions.
We'll take a short break and then we'll be back with you to see this smart girl, stay with us.
The actor's performance, the audience is very smart now.
If any show catches his attention from the first, second, or third episode, and if he feels uninterested, he'll use the remote.
He won't bother, he has twenty thousand other series.
Correct, the Twenty Thousand Leagues series, that's right.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people don't focus on one task.
He can see other works.
This is true, this is the majority.
He says I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you among us, a very dear and honorable guest, Abdel Hamid Cherchani.
Would you like to say something to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Would you like to say something?
And I say to them, hopefully every year finds you in good health.
It's true that we don't go out much, and we don't act frequently due to the reason I've already mentioned.
What's coming will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all success in this year's work.
Insha'Allah, we'll have another interview with you so we can talk about those plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are looked forward to by trend lovers.
Welcome, dear viewers, to Sabah Doha. We are live with you.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who have registered at this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing other capabilities.
And also to make their minds work fully.
Ms. Naseem and Mr. Ayman Khalegly, Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning
Welcome! It's great to have you with us.
And with us is the beautiful Oumnia, good morning Oumnia.
Good morning
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best.
What are the things we provide for our sons and daughters?
This was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Naseem, and it was specifically directed towards the benefit of our children, our sons.
The program "Minds" for mental math.
Through the fingers and Abax.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to present a small part of them.
Did you feel, Professor Ibrahim, that there was indeed a difference between the student in his first two days?
And after he finishes, maybe in three or four months?
if taught in public, private, or even independent schools
Basically, the program scientifically works on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
"This highlights the missing capabilities or the need to continue developing them."
He reached a certain level or what updates happened to the child?
So we work in a scientific way, with a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a routine manner;
But in a scientific, systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers. Amany is one of the students who registered at this center.
We wanted to do that right away today to show our viewers the importance of these things.
If you return the coat, I have no objection.
This is a very fast and very short part of a series of septuplets that we will see the second part of.
But as we saw, this part of the series classifies the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tasnif," where each episode has a different theme?
This year, focus on the fact that you will...
"Qafil Fadil"
Encouraging through providing opportunities
Sixteen episodes in Season 2.
He will be a director in an episode, in one episode he will be an old man, and in another episode, he will be a baker.
It's a collection of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti from Qatar
We have representatives from Qatar.
There are many actors that I can't recall right now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain like Zahra Arafat and Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Rashid and Mohamed Adel Faction
Tara, of course
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
Currently, we have some projects in Qatar. There are two projects per year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, can we say that as well?
Qatar TV provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV did its best, but with only one production a year, all Qatari actors want to work.
And that's the reason.
I replied to you. This is just one series, and all the actors in Qatar want to work on it.
If someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Praise be to God, for everything.
Let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I'd like to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jassim is among the best of humans, even after the dispersion, yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him for television and theater.
He is one of those who adopted us, taught us, and raised us.
Then, Mr. Ghaneem came in his autobiography, doing his best, in Faisal Towsh 2000.
Because he gives us opportunities as young people.
They have thirty to thirty-two works a year.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
The deadly feeling is also produced by Tara Arts.
The director of the series is Mr. Mounir %PW.
We're back with you again, dear viewers, and today we're talking about reflexology.
The message via the palm, the hand palm.
This treatment has indeed been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest with us.
The inspection method is as follows.
It's swelling, the degree of pain.
You can feel inside the hand that there's something like sand or broken veins inside the hand.
Loosen your grip.
My brother is under a lot of stress.
You feel some pressure and a little tension, tension.
Left side
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health problem would be evident, we now know about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means trouble.
Problem! What do you mean by problem in this context?
In this case, the sinuses, the ear.
He's vibrating, do you have a sinus problem or any previous issue?
I had surgery, but it was a long time ago.
Is it a tumor or something like that?
He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is due to nerves, when I told him he had tense nerves.
Ten years ago, he was walking barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, I think they empty out.
Any uneven ground is not just the sea.
Negative energy could be %PW.
And he was surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Of course, children are the most important.
Boys, glorified be God. This is for the mother, focus with me!
What hurts him is the milk and the food he eats.
Her child is parallel to her, she will put him down and the baby will automatically close.
Close your hand.
Just a little pressure, thank God.
You'll find him in a few seconds and the child will be happy. First, he'll be in pain due to the hurt here.
Later, you will see a sudden release of gas.
What are your findings, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, now people suffer from arthritis, bones, headaches, thyroid and obesity.
The second thing for menstrual pains or period pain in general.
You must focus on a rock or stone, by pressing here, you are commanding the Lord of Glory to release the lower back and pelvic issues. If you have pain,
In seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
Delivery became easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her that she can give birth in the seventh month or she might give birth in the ninth.
Except on sand.
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on rocks, no.
You should eat seven soft dates for breakfast, the soft date is better.
If she doesn't have smooth tamarind, dates are enough.
"I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan, my discovery is from the Quran."
This means that God was not unable to make these soft dates reach her, no, He was not unable.
Praise be to Allah, and I seek refuge in You from myself.
You must bring small stones or balls.
Delivery bed. For example, if you forget and come to the delivery bed, hold the handles.
You'll notice in private hospitals, a group of East Asian ladies coming.
This is a practice in East Asia.
You already have my phone.
Just the mobile!
I advise everyone who is listening to me now to cooperate with each other.
Make charity a habit and also take care of others. You were created to worship God, so do it.
To serve people is the first thing. Second, I am not a religious leader or a sheikh, I am an ordinary man.
I would like to thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and also thank our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak more about that.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start by taking a look at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
Is it part of the national strategy for the treatment and control of obesity?
Around four of the top countries in the world for obesity are Gulf states.
We launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and relevant authorities to combat obesity.
I'm afraid it will spread more and more soon.
One of the programs for obesity protection is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can organize this competition together, making it an international event.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age,
Because it's the first stage where they become aware of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, it was about your favorite fruit?
The second week is walking.
You have to walk! Every time you walk, he gets points.
This is a map of Qatar, and every time someone gets points, they walk and their school moves and their class moves.
A beautiful competition was opened among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, not soda.
Tell him to drink water. There's no need to drink that much soda every time you feel thirsty. Drink water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that some people don't like.
We are looking for a sport he loves.
So that we can pressure him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows that they should allow their child to eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so we can take.
Of course, this is a model, and with its success, God willing, we will gain more experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we enjoyed a lot with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin is better now, less acne.
This is true, this is true and becomes consciousness.
Parents know about their children.
And their peers in different classes ask them, "How are you?" and they learn from their peers.
Praise be to God, many schools are already expressing enthusiasm to participate next year.
Inshallah
Qatari telecommunications company was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had the Aspire zone which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On, on, on, on the dining table.
So praise be to Allah for many things, some of which I have mentioned and some of which I have forgotten.
But praise be to God, everyone participated with a part.
And secondly, the brothers were doing it in the form of separate lessons, a curriculum, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different types and involve as many people as possible.
They are the next generation.
To spread this experience as widely as possible in Qatar.
When you move in, there are some things you need to fix.
After its spread now and achieving satisfactory results
God willing, we will publish it because some people are asking us why we weren't present.
Eat, eat healthy food and you'll get there, you won't have a problem.
When we are at this age, and when it starts from a young age, it reaches what it wants by the age of twenty or twenty-five
You mentioned a series of titles, and each group had its own title.
If we return, we'll try in our section today to be about closing events.
And when we mentioned people again in our program, we had more than one host.
Let's review and what were the information for each week that we wanted to convey to the student.
Alright, first thing, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Every lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits containing vitamin C?
So he began to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why not eat the rest?
The second week is walking, people think that walking is only for the elderly and why should young people walk?
So when I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it relaxes your mind and brain.
It relaxes the individual, which means clarity of mind improves.
I took the students on tours.
Yes, they were all required to walk, whether at home or at school.
They earn their points through the class teacher.
What they used to walk on daily.
It was an event; people marched, the girls' school marched.
I want them to love this, being creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers should think outside the box; we don't want them to give them ideas and they should stick to them.
Everyone has their skill in this area.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water. We keep trying to get them to drink water so they don't feel thirsty and cravedădădădădăd
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we could find out his favorite sport and support him in it,
He is interested in sports.
His love for sports is evident through his practice of them; he plays sports unconsciously.
We said previously that we would talk about the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Let me welcome our guest for today's show who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We're happy to have you here at this show.
And part of it is this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease.
This effect on the nervous system in the person's body.
The period between twenty and forty years.
This disease remains untreated and the cause of suffering from this disease is unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, which is usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from any harm and other illnesses.
This disease is an infection of the brain's neural nerves and the spinal cord's spinal nerves.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes that a foreign body has entered the body.
Neurons are
Cover this wire.
White cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
Which leads to the absence, weakness, or disruption of the nerve signal.
Leads to paralysis, may God protect you.
No, with the development and progress in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Okay, aside from the solution, we want to know how to reach it.
Also, a person should have protection from this thing.
The main reason, is it quality of life, nature of food or flows of life?
Or what is the direct cause that prompts a person to suffer from this illness.
All we have now are theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems faced by humans.
Yes, yes.
All these topics can be controversial in some way within society.
So far, we know the reasons.
Okay, the age group that can have this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Of course, after forty years, the disease starts to subside with the person.
So far, we have not been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a lot of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And also Qatar.
Recently, just last week, they told me about three to four cases that were diagnosed.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, and this is recorded in the files.
Many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go for treatment in other countries.
Okay, Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any signs that someone has been affected by this disease?
Are there any signs that show the patient's family or the patient themselves that they are suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, kills.
We must be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Because nerve disease, nerves control the whole body.
In providing a specific reason for a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
