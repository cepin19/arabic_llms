Jesus called a little child to him and had the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Anyone who welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me stumbles and falls away? It would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the depths of the sea.
How terrible it would be for the world because of the things that make people make mistakes! These things must come. But how terrible it would be for those who cause them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into the fire with two hands and two feet. In the fire, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
Don't underestimate any of these children. I'm telling you this: their angels in heaven can come at any time to visit their parents in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep, and one of them gets lost. Won't he leave the 99 sheep on the mountains? Won't he go and search for the one that's lost?
What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds the sheep, he will be happier with what he found than if he hadn't found 99 of them.
The same goes for your father in heaven. He doesn't like any of these little ones to be lost. If anyone wrongs you...
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you've won him back.
But what if he won't listen to you? Then take one or two others along with you, for a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, this is what I am telling you. If two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them." The servant who had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy and seven times."
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wants to collect all the money his subjects owe him.
As soon as the king started doing it, a man who owed him millions of dollars showed up.
The man couldn't pay. So his creditor gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and everything he owned had to be sold to repay his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll pay you back everything."
Sido felt it. Forgive him for what he did and let him go.
But the other servant took to flight and met one of his fellow servants who owed him a little money. Seizing him by the throat, he began to choke him, saying, "Pay back what you owe me!"
The other servant fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
The first servant refused. Instead, he walked away and left the man to be imprisoned. The man would remain in jail until he could repay what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. They were very distressed. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then, the master called the first servant. He said to him, "O servant of evil, I have forgiven you for everything you owe me, because you begged me."
Was it not more fitting for you to have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?
In his anger, the lady handed him over to the guards. He was to be punished until he returned everything to her.
This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them immediately.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, 'That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.' (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man should not separate what God has joined.
They asked, "Why did Moses command that a man give his wife a divorce certificate and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
Hani naqulk. Ay wahid yotlaq marto wyetzawwej mar'a ukhra yertekib al-zina. Ar-rajul yujem yotlaq marto kan kanat muwalata ma'ah. (Translation: I tell you, any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife if she is unfaithful to him.)
The students told him, "If it's like that between a man and a woman, it's better not to get married."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those to whom it is given can live without marriage."
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some are created that way by others. Others make themselves that way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living that way, must do so. The little children come to Jesus.
Some people brought their children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Don't stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went away from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man approached Jesus and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus answered, 'There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments.'"
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus said, "'Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness.
'Honor your father and your mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've followed all these instructions," the young man said. "What more do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he left sadly. It was very expensive.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, "What could happen?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered, "We have left everything to follow you! What will be our reward?"
Truly, I say to you, Jesus told them, when all things are renewed, the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne. Then, you who followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Everyone who has left their home, family, or fields because of me will receive a hundred times more, and eternal life.
Many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owns a field. Early in the morning, he went out to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will give you what is right.'
They left. "He went out again around noon, and at three o'clock he did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one has hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last ones hired, and then go to the others."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock came. Each one received the usual daily wage.
By the time the first appointees arrived, they expected to receive more. However, each of them also received the usual daily wage.
As soon as they arrived, they started complaining about the landlord.
These are the people who were hired last time, they only worked for an hour, they said. You paid them the same as you paid us. We did most of the work and were under the hot sun all day.
The owner answered one of them. He said, "Boss, I'm treating you fairly. Didn't we agree that you would work for a regular daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I'd rather give my last breath to those I appointed the same wage I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel disappointed because you gave to others so freely?
"Those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last. Jesus speaks again about his upcoming death."
Jesus was walking towards Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside and spoke to them privately.
"We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"And then they will hand him over to people who are not Jewish. They will mock him and beat him with whips. They will crucify him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asked Jesus a favor.
The mother of the sons of Zebedes came to Jesus with her sons. Bowing down, she asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked. She said, "Grant me that one of my sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
You do not know what you are asking, Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The remaining nine heard this story. They were angry with the two brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Don't be like that. On the contrary, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as the price to set many people free. Two blind men are transformed and see.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The group was ordered to stop. They were told to be quiet. But the two men shouted even more, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Oh Lord," they said, "we wish we could see."
Jesus felt deep compassion. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a donkey tied there, with its colt beside it. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone tells you something, tell them that the Lord needs them. The owner will send them right away.
This is what the Prophet foretold becoming a reality. He said,
"Say to the city of Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' (Zechariah 9:9)"
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They put their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large group spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and the rest followed. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple. He began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also overturned the chairs of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you make it 'a den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
Blind people and those with disabilities came to Jesus in the temple. He healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" When they saw this, they were indignant.
Do you hear what these children are saying? they asked him. Jesus said, "Yes." Haven't you read," he replied, "that from the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth praise?" (Psalm 8:2)
And after he went out from the people, and went to the country of the Gergesenes. And when he came to the other
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to the city of Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree beside the road. He went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the fig tree withered.
When the students saw the story, they were surprised. "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what I did to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will happen."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "I too will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, 'of men'? They were afraid of the people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So Jesus answered them, "I do not know." Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things. The parable of the two sons."
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I won't do it," the son replied. But later, he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, "Yes, sir." But he did not go.
Which of the two sons did what his father asked? The first one, he answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John tried to show you the right way to live. You didn't believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes who sold themselves did believe. I have seen this. Yet you have not turned from your sins and believed him. The story of the tenants.
Hear another story. A man had a piece of land where he planted a vineyard. He surrounded it with a wall. He dug a winepress in it. And he built a watchtower. He leased it to the farmers. Then he went on a journey.
The time of harvest was near, so he sent his servants to the tenants. He told the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
As for the tenants, they seized his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed him. And they threw stones at the third one to kill him.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, I sold my son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
Then the vineyard owners saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and drove him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
"When the vine is destroyed, they will return. Then he will rent the vineyard to other tenants. They will give him his share of the harvest at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what the Scriptures say? 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.' (Psalm 118:22-23)
Hani, I'll tell you what. The kingdom of God is like a seed that you plant. It's for others to come and bear fruit from it.
Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken into pieces. As for the stone, it will crush anyone who falls on it.
The priests and the scribes heard Jesus' stories. They knew who he was talking about.
So they sought a way to arrest him, but they feared the crowd. People believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Jesus told them more parables. He said,
Hani shnouwa kifach ykon mamlakat essama. Malik hadr 3rass labnuh. Translation: How can the Kingdom of Heaven be like a king who attended his son's wedding.
He sent his servants to the people he invited to dinner. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
And afterward, he sent out some of his slaves. He said to them, "Go and tell the invited guests, 'Behold, I have prepared my banquet; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
As for the people, they didn't care. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The rest were taken by Abdou. He treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready. But those I invited did not deserve to come."
Walk to the corners of the streets. Invite anyone you meet for dinner.
And so the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they found, whether good or bad. Soon, the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man present who was not wearing wedding attire.
Owner, he asked, "How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't find words to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They planned to entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, nor do you cater to their whims. You don't care how important they are."
So, what do you say? Is it right that we pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. He brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Who is this in the picture? And what are the words?"
"Render unto Caesar," they said. And he replied, "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were astonished. They went out from the tomb and said nothing. The marriage of the dead when they send them.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
The teacher said, "This is what Moses told us. A man who dies without children, his brother must marry the widow. He must have children so that he can inherit his brother's name."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven were married to her.
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures. And you do not know the power of God."
For they are like angels in heaven, neither marrying nor being given in marriage. And those who die and leave this world do not marry. Their parents do not give them in marriage either.
What's your opinion on the dead rising? Haven't you read what God said to you?
He said, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
Like the cloud heard this, it was astonished at what it taught. The greatest commandment.
The Pharisees heard what the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "What is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important testament.
"And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)"
"Everything written in the Torah and the Prophets is built on these two commandments." Who is the son of whom Christ?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What is your opinion about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They answered him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him 'Lord', how can he be David's son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him another question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
You need to obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and put them on other people's shoulders. But they themselves don't even want to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is for people to see. They wear small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the Holy Book. They make the boxes very wide. And they lengthen the fringes on their coats a lot.
They like to sit in the places of honor at dinners. They also like to be in the most important seats in the temples.
They love to be greeted in the markets. They love it when people call them 'Lord'.
Don't call him 'Lord'. You have one Lord, and you are all brothers.
Don't call anyone on earth "Father." You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher'. You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you should be your servant.
Anyone who raises himself will come down, and anyone who comes down will rise.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter."
(No
"What a terrible thing it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel everywhere to convert one person to your religion, and then you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are."
Shame on you, blind guides! You say, "Whoever swears by the temple, it means nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated to fulfill his oath."
You are blind and stupid! What's more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that worships gold?
You also say, "If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath."
Oh blind ones! What is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that sanctifies the gift?
Therefore, whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever takes an oath in the name of the temple, swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of my Lord and what is upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, and then the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
The same with you. From the outside, you seem to be doing what's necessary, but from the inside, you're full of what's not right. You pretend to be something you're not.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous."
And they say, 'If we had been living in the days of those who came before us, we would not have done as they did. We would not have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets.'
You bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Finish the sins that those before you have started!
O den of venomous snakes! How can you escape being sentenced to fire?
For I send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You kill some of them. You crucify some of them. And others you scourge in your temples. You chase them from town to town.
"How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" We cry out for the blood of all the righteous, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom You killed between the temple and the altar.
What I'm about to tell you is true. All of this is going to happen to the people living now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. Many times I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would not let me!
Look, your house is empty.
We say to you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus went out of the temple. He was walking away when his disciples came to him, pointing out the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all these things?" Jesus asked. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him in private and said, "Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Be on your guard against those who would deceive you."
Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah!' and they will deceive many people.
You hear about wars. You also hear people talking about future wars. Don't worry. These things have to happen. But the end is not here yet.
Nations will fight nations. Kingdoms will fight kingdoms. People will starve. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of the birth pangs.
And then people will greet you, mistreat you, and kill you. All nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people were far from their faith. They hated each other. They handed each other over to the enemy.
Many false prophets will arise to deceive many people.
Where evil grows, the love of most people cools.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This good news about the kingdom is to be spread throughout the whole world. It will be a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
Prophet David spoke of the "abhorrent necessity that destroys" (Psalm 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
So those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof needs to go down to their house to get something.
No one in the field needs to go back and get their coat.
How hard it must be for pregnant women these days! How hard it must be for nursing mothers!
Claim what you don't have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
It will be a severe torment in these days. It will be worse than any other torment from the beginning of the world until now. And there will be nothing like it afterward.
If time weren't limited, no one would live. But because it is, it will be shortened for the chosen people of God.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if they can.
See, I told you before time.
If they tell you, "He's far out in the desert," don't go there. And if they say, "He's drowned inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. The same will happen when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures gather wherever there is a corpse.
After the terrible suffering of these days, "the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
That He may send His messengers with the trumpet's blast. That He may gather together His chosen servants from every side. That He may bring them from the ends of the heavens to the other end.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, to see all these things happen, you know the end is near. It's at the door.
What I'm about to tell you is true. The people who were living at that time would not die until all these things happened.
The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows the day or the hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They got married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know anything about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men were in the field. One was to be taken, and the other was to be left.
Two women grinding with a manual stone. One to keep and the rest to discard.
So remain vigilant. You don't know on what day your Lord will come.
You need to understand something. Assume that the homeowner knew what time of night the thief was going to come. At that time, he would have been watching. He wouldn't have left the house unsecured.
You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Suppose a master put one of his slaves in charge of the other slaves in his house. The slave's duty is to feed them at the right time. The master loves a faithful and wise slave for this.
It would be better for the servant if the master found him serving in his service when he returns.
What I'm about to tell you is true. The master will give the slave this responsibility over everything he owns.
Let's assume that this servant is evil. Let's assume he says to himself, 'My master has been gone for a long time.'
Suppose he starts beating other slaves. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of the servant will return on a day the servant does not expect. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
And then the lord cuts him into pieces. He sends him to the place where the claimants go. There, people weep and gnash their teeth.
The Tale of the Ten Brides
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.
Fools take their lamps, but they don't take olive oil with them.
The wise took the oil in their vessels with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the brides got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted, 'The groom! Come out to meet him!'
And after that, all the witnesses awoke and prepared their lanterns.
Fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No," they said. "It might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil sellers. Buy some for yourselves."
They went to buy oil. While they were on their way, the groom arrived. The girls who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. And then the door was closed.
Then, the rest of the bridesmaids also came. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I'm telling you is true. I don't know you."
So stay vigilant. You don't know the day or the hour the bridegroom will come. The story of the three slaves.
Again, it is like a kingdom of heaven. A man went on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted them with his wealth.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each slave the amount he knew they could manage. Then he set off on his journey.
The server who received the ten thousand dollars immediately invested it in the service. He made another ten thousand dollars.
He who has $4,000 gains $4,000 more.
As for the man who received $2000, he went to dig a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made $10,000 more."
Sido replied, "Well done, my faithful and trustworthy servant! You have been faithful in a few things. I will give you responsibility over many things. Come and share in your master's joy!"
The man with $4000 is coming extra. He said, "Sir, trust me, I have an extra $4000."
Sido replied, "Well done, my faithful and trustworthy servant! You have been faithful in a few things. I will give you authority over many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
Then the man who received $2000 came. He said, "Sir, I know you are a harsh man. You reap where you did not sow and gather grain where you did not scatter seed."
I was afraid, so I went out and buried the $2000 I had in the ground. Look, this is what belongs to you.
Sido replied, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you not know that I reap where I have not sown? Did you not know that I gather crops where I have not scattered seed?"
Please, you should have put my money in the bank. When we return, we'll give it back to you with interest.
Then his master called the other servants and said, "Take the $2000 from him and give it to the one who has $20,000."
Those who have will be given more. So that they have more than enough. What about those who have nothing? Even those who have will have it taken from them.
Throw the worthless slave out. In the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth. 'The sheep and the goats'
The Son of Man is going to come in his glory with all his angels. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All nations will be gathered before Him. To separate people into two groups. Like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
So he put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right, "Father, bless you. Come and take what is yours. This is the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the creation of the world.
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes, and you gave them to me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'
When did I see you a stranger and invite you in? When did I see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When did I see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The king replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you have done for one of my brothers, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. You did not invite me in. I needed clothes. You did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. You did not take care of me.
They will answer, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?"
He answers you, "What I'm telling you is true. Anything I haven't done for anyone, I haven't done for you."
And then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done right will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"It's not the holiday season," they said. "People might cause trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, who had a leprosy.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this talk?" they asked.
The perfume used to be sold at a high price. Money can be given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."
There will always be weak people with you. But I won't always be with you.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What I have done is to be said wherever this good news is preached throughout the world. It is to be said in his memory." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" They offered him thirty pieces of silver.
From that moment, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
Reply, "I am going to the city for one of the people. Tell him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. Let us celebrate Passover in your house with my disciples.''"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them. They prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
As they were eating, he told them, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will betray me."
The pupils became very sad. One after another, they started saying to him, "Not me, Lord, right?"
Jesus answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me."
The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had never been born.
Judas is the one who will betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, not me?" Jesus replied, "Yes, you."
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke it. He gave it to his disciples and said, "Take this and eat it. This is my body."
Then he took the cup, praised God, and gave it to them. He said, "All of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Hani, I tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Afterward they sang a hymn and went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away from me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
And after we rise from the dead, we will go before you to Galilee.
Peter replied, "Everyone else can walk away from you. I never will."
"What I'm going to tell you is true," Jesus answered. "It will happen tonight, before the cock crows, you will say three times that you don't know me."
But Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never say I don't know you." And all the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My spirit is very sad. I feel like I am about to die. Stay here. Keep watch with me."
He walked a little forward. Then he fell with his face to the ground. He prayed, "Papa, if you can, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet, let what you want happen, not what I want."
He came back to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
Look and pray. That's how you won't fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again. He prayed, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; but if it must be, let it be as you will."
He came back again. He found them sleeping again. He couldn't get their eyes to open.
He dismissed them and walked again. For the third time, he prayed the same thing.
He returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
Come on! Let's go! Hani is coming to greet them! Jesus is arrested.
As Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, arranged a signal with them. He said, "The one I kiss is the man; seize him."
Then Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
You think I can't ask Dad for help? He sends an army of over 70,000 angels right away.
But how can the sacred texts be donated? They say it must be done this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. He said, "Am I leading an armed band against you?" He asked, "Was it necessary for you to come out with swords and clubs to capture me?" Every day I was sitting in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.
"All this has happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Jewish council.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not long after, Peter followed Jesus. He went straight into the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus, so that they could put him to death.
But they didn't find any evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Eventually, other witnesses came forward.
They said, "That man said, 'The star of the temple of my Lord has fallen. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes. Just as you say," Jesus replied. "But I tell you this: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
And then the high priest tore his clothes. He said, "He has spoken blasphemy against the Lord! Why do we need other witnesses? You heard him say these evil words."
"What's your opinion?" "He must die!" they answered.
And then they spat in his face. They hit him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. "You were also with Jesus of Galilee," she said to him.
In front of everyone, Peter said it wasn't him. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. Another woman saw him there. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said it wasn't him. He swore, "I don't know the man!"
After a while, the people standing over there went to Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "The way you talk gives you away."
And then Peter started cursing himself. He swore and said to them, "I don't know this man!" Immediately the rooster crowed.
And afterward, Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him. "The rooster will crow," Jesus had said, "before you deny three times that you know me." Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hanged himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and regret for what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I made a mistake. I released a guilty man." They said, "What's it to us? It's your problem."
So Judas threw the coins into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The high priests collected the money. They said, "It is illegal to put this money in the temple treasury. This is blood money. It was paid to kill a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy the pottery field for a cemetery for people from other countries to be buried there.
That is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
And then the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said, "They paid 30 pieces of silver. This was the price set on the life of the people of Israel."
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus answered Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the great scholars and elders accused him, he did not respond.
Then Pilate asked, "Don't you hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whoever they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
When the people were gathered together, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas? or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While you were sitting on the judge's chair, your wife sent you a message. She said, "Don't interfere with that man. He is innocent. I suffered a lot in today's dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which one would you like me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What then shall we do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What wrong has he done?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Belat saw that no one was following him. On the contrary, the crowd began to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am not responsible for this man's death," he said. "You are responsible for this!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will accept the guilt for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but had Jesus scourged. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a purple robe.
And then they wove thorns together to make a crown, which they placed on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They are cursing him. They hit him on the head with a stick once and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They dressed him in his clothes again. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat and watched him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted insults at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "You say, 'I will destroy this temple and in three days I will build it again'? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, teachers of the law, and elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others," but they also said, "But he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God save him now if He loves him. It is he who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" This means "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who were standing there heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
One of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the temple curtain was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split apart.
The tombs were broken. Many holy people who had died rose from the dead.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus rose from the dead, they went to the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what happened. They were terrified. They cried out, "Truly he was the Son of God!"
Not a few women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also there. Salome, the mother of the sons of Zebedee, was likewise present. Jesus is buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus, came.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
Put it in his new tomb he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the tomb's door. Then he walked away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb
The next day was after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Paul.
Sir, they said, "We remember something the liar said while he was still alive. He said, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
Give the order to guard the tomb until the third day. If you don't, his disciples might come and steal the body, and then they'll tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead. That last lie will be worse than the first one.
"Take a few guards with you," said Pilate. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
They went and made the tomb secure. They put a seal on it and posted guards.
Jesus rose from the dead.
The day of rest was just ending. Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. An angel from the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb, rolled back the stone, and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His garment was white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they trembled and turned as white as sheets.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
He's not here! He got up and did as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Walk quickly! Tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' That is what I have told you.
For the women were afraid, yet filled with joy, and ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly, Jesus met them. He said to them, "Peace!" They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell them to return to me in Galilee. There they will see me." The guards went and reported to the chief priests.
As we women were walking, some guards entered the city. They informed the high priests of everything that had happened.
When the great Tunisians met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the Sultan hears this report, we'll pay him off. That's how you get out of trouble.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final orders to his disciples.
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw it, they worshiped it. However, some of them still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
You shall go and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And you can be sure that I am always with you, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He baptized people in the wilderness. He also called people to be baptized and to repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem also went out. They confessed their sins, and John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wears clothes made of camel hair. He has a leather belt around his waist. He eats locusts and wild honey.
"After me comes one stronger than I. I cannot untie his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming out of the water. At that moment, he saw the sky split open. He saw the Holy Spirit descend on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven. It said, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very proud of you."
At that time, the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. The devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God.
"The time is fulfilled," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day, Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come. Follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
For now, they left their windows and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he did, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
Always call on them. Leave their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and follow Jesus. Jesus drives out an evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He did not speak like the scribes.
Suddenly, one of the men in their synagogue cried out. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One from God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with great authority! Even the evil spirits obey him."
The news about Jesus spread rapidly throughout all of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple. They went directly with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Sometimes his wife was stretched out on the bed. She had a fever. They told him to call Jesus for her.
He walked to her. He held her hand and helped her stand up. The fever had left her. Then she started taking care of them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus often withdrew to solitary places and prayed.
It was still very dark in the morning when Isa got up and left the house. He walked to a place where he could be alone. There, he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to meet Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone's looking for you!"
Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I must preach there as well. That is why I came."
He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. Kneeling, he begged Jesus. He said, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be cleansed!"
Throughout his illness, he kept it to himself. He treated himself.
Jesus sent him away at once. He gave him a stern warning.
"Don't tell anyone this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are clean."
As for the man, he went out and began to proclaim it far and wide. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly; he remained in the countryside, but people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news of his return spread throughout the town.
A large crowd gathered, and there was no more room, not even outside the door. And Jesus taught the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the man down on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Praise God who forgives sins!
Isa always knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"You should know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the man who could not walk, "Get up and walk."
"I told you," he said, "Get up. Take your mat and go to the house."
The man got up and picked up his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Again, Jesus went out to the seashore of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd followed him. He began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him. Levi got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus was dining in the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
Some teachers of the law who were Pharisees were present. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast often and pray, but yours eat and drink. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples fast often, and the disciples of the Pharisees also fast. But yours eat and drink. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot fast as long as he is with them."
But the time when the groom comes to take them is delayed. On that day, they go without eating.
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do that, the new piece will pull away from the old one. That will only make the tear worse.
People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the old skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Reply, "Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
At that time, Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of the Lord and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some of it to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Therefore the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.
Healing on Saturday
Again, Jesus entered the synagogue. There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They loved to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day.
Jesus said to the man with the weak and distorted hand, "Stand up in front of everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or destroy one?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very upset because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored.
And after that the Pharisees went out, and held a council with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the sea of Galilee with his disciples. A great multitude from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, and the surrounding regions, including Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the area around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him, so that he would not be crushed by the people.
Jesus healed many people. Sick people would push themselves forward to touch him.
When the people with evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve messengers.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called to some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach.
They had authority to cast out demons.
Why did Jesus appoint the twelve? Simon was one of them. Jesus renamed him Peter.
They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
In English: "There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus. Also, Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot."
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who later handed Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Belazebub.
Jesus entered a house. Once again, a large crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about this story. They went to get him and take care of him. They said about him, "He is crazy."
Some teachers of the law were there. They had come down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he drives out demons."
So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables. He said to them, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights with its own soul, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
